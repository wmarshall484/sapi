He was said to have an incredibly large mouth with stained teeth, and supposedly had a visible vapor rising off of his body. His parents kicked him out as a teenager because he was literally eating them out of house and home.

He ate any and everything, including live animals, stones, silverware, anything he could get his hands on. The French military even tried employing him as a courier to smuggle documents by eating them.

No doctor was able to find a cause or a cure to his appetite. He was eventually kicked out of the military hospital where they were studying him, after falling under suspicion of eating a 14 month old child that went missing from the same hospital. A reasonable suspicion, since they caught him trying to eat dead bodies in the morgue on several occasions.[The death of Gloria Ramirez](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Ramirez)

He lived and worked close to the Kirtland Airforce base and intercepted what he believed to be alien communications at what he called the Dulce Base.

He very well may have been the target of a government operation where he was fed false information and documents verifying his alien hypothesis by intelligence agents working for the Airforce Office of Special Investigations.

He was pushed to the brink and ended up in a mental health hospital, and his story is full of X-Files-esque intrigue like photographs of landed UFOs he took from the air (he was a private pilot) being stolen from his house.

There have been a few book written about it, the best being Project Beta by Greg Bishop.

>The forest was named after a shepherd that disappeared in the area with a flock of two hundred sheep. Most people who live near the forest are afraid to enter it due to the stories and legends that have been handed down. They believe that those who visit the site will never return back home. Many of the locals who have been brave enough to venture into the forest complained of physical harm, including rashes, nausea, vomiting, migraines, burns, scratches, anxiety, and other unusual sensations.

She was in a disheveled but seaworthy condition, under partial sail, with no one on board, and her lifeboat missing. The last log entry was dated ten days earlier. She had left New York City for Genoa on November 7, and on discovery was still amply provisioned. Her cargo of denatured alcohol was intact, and the captain's and crew's personal belongings were undisturbed. None of those who had been on board the captain and his wife, their two-year-old daughter, and the crew of seven were ever seen or heard from againUFO encounters occurring at US military facilities is an interesting one to examine, where in some cases at the time of the UFO sightings, American conventional and nuclear missile systems mysteriously malfunctioned and shut down, with no credible reasoning or explanation given for these sudden failures.

Sounds pretty crazy, right? Well, there is in fact quite a bit of official documentation and eyewitness reports from a bunch of quite credible military officials and contractors to back up many of these apparent close encounter UFO incidents that took place at or around various secure military facilities and missile systems over the years. 

Here is an example [highlighting one bit of testimony of an incident that occurred at Maelstrom USAF base (Montana) in 1967, in which 10 Minuteman nuclear missiles apparently mysteriously went offline when a UFO](http://www.cufon.org/cufon/malmstrom/malm1.htm) was reported by multiple individuals around the facility. [Here is a brief video describing some of the testimony of this incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaJ0Xj1SqN8), and again, there were multiple eyewitnesses involved who have gone on the record about this UFO encounter.

The 1980 ["Rendlesham_Forest_incident"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident) is another well publicized and very interesting case which took place in England at the twin NATO air base facilities of RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters, and has plenty of official documentation to support that something very bizarre happened that night. 

During a nuclear missile test (using a dummy warhead aboard) that was flown out of Vandenburg AFB in California in 1964, there was another close encounter incident where a UFO was apparently caught on film. [In this case, known as the "Big Sur Incident", the UFO was apparently seen on film rendezvousing with the missile in flight](http://www.ufohastings.com/articles/ufos-are-stalking-and-intercepting-dummy-nuclear-warheads-during-test-flights), orbiting it while the missile was traveling some 8000 miles per hour downrange towards Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific, [with the UFO shooting what was described as "beams of light" at the missile, resulting in the destruction of the booster and dummy warhead payload.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZXeuojL_FQ)     

If you want to read a really interesting and quite well-researched book about this subject matter that contains these and plenty more case studies of different incidents, including declassified documentation and eyewitness testimony from people who have gone on the record about this topic, I highly suggest giving ["UFOs and Nukes" by author Robert Hastings a look](http://www.ufohastings.com/book).

FmlIn a village in Sweden called Rjdn there's a cross-shaped "hole" in the ground that won't go away. Over many years people tried to digg it out, fill it up, etc. but it comes back. Nothing grows there, and if you plan something in it it dies. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeoUA4nkDUU[Ursula and Sabina Eriksson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_and_Sabina_Eriksson) are Swedish twins who supposedly went totally fucking batshit crazy together for roughly 72 hours. There's footage (and subsequently a whole documentary) of them repeatedly throwing themselves into oncoming traffic and getting hit/run over by multiple cars and even an 18-wheeler. When police arrived to sort things out, they became extremely violent like cornered animals, eventually leading them to need restraints just to administer medical attention. 

One was charged with assaulting a police officer when she was released from the hospital (a span of a few hours), to which she responded apathetically or even cheerfully. After something like 2 days in a holding cell, she plead guilty and was sentenced 1 day (which she already served) and was released. 

Something like a day later, some guy found her wandering around the street looking lost/confused. He invited her in to let her use his phone and try to track down the sister (who was still in the hospital, I believe), and she apparently stabbed the guy 3-4 times in the chest, killing him. 

I say "apparently" because all the evidence suggested that it was her, but she never actually gave her account of what happened. She answered every question with "no comment" from the moment of arrest throughout the trial. 

To top the whole thing off, doctors at the trial declared that she was  insane when she committed the crime, but that she was now completely sane, and was not currently a risk to the public. The judge wanted to give her an indefinite sentence, so they would have more time to evaluate the possibility of it happening again. The law, however, required that he give her a definite sentence, since she was declared to not currently be a risk to the public. He sentenced her to 5 years in prison.

She was released in 2011 and has essentially fallen of the map since then. We know that she kept in contact with her twin through her sentence, and that they likely reunited upon release, somewhere in America. 

**TL;DR**
Swedish twins [repeatedly throw themselves into traffic](https://youtu.be/S20qTaXxgYw?t=78) and fight off cops, get arrested, treated, and released. One goes on to stab a random good samaritan and gets a 5 year sentence. The medical diagnosis was essentially that they shared a temporary psychosis and are now completely sane.

Also the subject of an awesome documentary Resurrect Dead: https://youtu.be/U28DdfwjiKoThe monkey man would have made a great episode

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey-man_of_Delhi

Summary from Wikipedia:

In May 2001, reports began to circulate in the Indian capital New Delhi of a strange monkey-like creature that was appearing at night and attacking people. Eyewitness accounts were often inconsistent, but tended to describe the creature as about four feet (120 cm) tall, covered in thick black hair, with a metal helmet, metal claws, glowing red eyes and three buttons on its chest; others, however, described the Monkey-man as having a more vulpine snout, and being up to eight feet tall, and muscular; it would leap from building to building like a parkour enthusiast. Still others have described it as a bandaged figure or as a helmeted thing. Theories on the nature of the Monkey Man ranged from an Avatar of the Hindu god Hanuman, to an Indian version of Bigfoot.

Many people reported being scratched, and two (by some reports, three) people even died when they leapt from the tops of buildings or fell down stairwells in a panic caused by what they thought was the attacker. At one point, exasperated police even issued artist's impression drawings in an attempt to catch the creature.

The entire incident has been described as an example of mass hysteria.Radio astronomer here!  A lot of people have by now heard about the [Wow! signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal), particularly if you hang out a lot on Reddit, but there are many other strange signals we've heard from the sky we can't explain.  One cool example is [The Great Galactic Burper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCRT_J1745-3009).  In short, back in 1998 radio astronomers pointed towards the galactic center heard five loud bursts of radiation, that were ten minutes long or so with 77 minutes separating the blasts.  It was really weird, no one knows what caused it, and no one has ever heard this or a similar burst ever again.

Pretty crazy stuff!A mysterious case from South Korea that had never been solved called the [Frog Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_Boys) about a group of boys (5) gone missing without their corpse, remaining, nor any evidence found for about 20 years. Even soon after a massive police search in the whole area foot-by-foot, nothing was found. However, 20 years later, their remaining have been spotted and discovered just right near their home area, which have already been searched for thoroughly. During this period, there were multiple theories and conspiracies. One professor also personally tried playing detective and accused one of the parents for being the offender with some logical contents and accusations.The thread a couple weeks ago about what was the freakiest thing that ever happened to you had this story about this guy is a 1920s-ish suit who chased a guy on all fours in a truck.

I ran a campaign where one of the players insisted on being a really buff baby. 

Needless to say she took penalties in movement. But a smart team player took throwing arm as her first feat, effectively creating a deadly fighting football. I hope I'm not too late, I think my last campaign would fit in perfectly with this thread.

One of the big problems I found in campaigns was keeping the less dedicated players interested. I hoped to solve this through windfall money and items usually around the end of the session, or after a big plot event. This worked pretty well, and it helped out by giving them less things to worry about, they were almost always moderately rich characters that can afford whatever cool shit they wanted to do.

After doing it a few times, it seemed rather dull. The more invested players didn't feel particularly rewarded for roleplaying well, or performing well in combat because everyone just got a bunch of stuff at the end anyway, so to keep those players interested, I devised a plan.

I decided that they could buy buildings and start a business, oh man, that was a mistake. As it turns out, one of our players was actually a business finance major, and he turned this little side story into a fully fledged business with charts detailing the costs and expected revenue of different aspects, and even a business plan.

Slowly over time, the game shifted more from their roleplaying adventures to the tavern they bought in like the second session, and the businesses they snagged up after. Instead of using the money to advance the plot, they would invest it all back into properties around the city.

I honestly thought all the other players would lose interest in the campaign because of the lack of action, but they all became super interested in the economics of this fantasy environment. Our party had 2 characters that couldn't read, but forced themselves to learn in order to help manage these businesses, and the players themselves actually went on to study economics in their free time, and I think one of them is planning on taking some fianance classes in this upcoming semester.

Since they weren't doing anything, I had to remind them that the big bad guy, a badass super-necromancer of doom, was still out there. You know what these fuckers do? They fucking hired like 50 mercenaries to go after this guy and distract him while the main business owner goes on a search for some famous slayers of evil wizards. Of course he was able to find a couple within the in-game week and give them offers that they cannot refuse. They show up, kill the necromancer, collect their reward, huge celebration, and then business continues as usual.

And just like that, the big bad guy was defeated through the unconventional role-playing means of building a business empire from the ground-up, then paying someone else to do it. The entire party were the fucking quest givers that usually hire the player characters.

**TL;DR: Be careful about allowing your players to have side projects within a campaign, it could derail the entire thing and turn your player characters into NPCs.**Not as a DM, but I once conspired with the DM to reverse pickpocket another player. I was a tiny fairy and he was a well armored paladin. Figured he wouldnt mind carrying my wins from battle, so every so often I would randomly roll and tell DM what I got. He would look at the guy and say "You feel.... heavier".  The guy was baffled for a few rolls of course. Me: As you explore the forest, you encounter a wild pig...

Player: I cast "Detect Evil!"

Me: This pig is not evil.

Player: I cast "Detect Magic!"

Me: This is a rare, non-magical pig.

Player: ...Detect bacon?

Me: You begin to have visions about tomorrow's breakfast...My players had just scaled the treacherous slopes of Mt Canine, and fought their way through the goblin-infested hallways of the keep to reach the inner sanctum. After opening the door to the final room, they discover that it is populated by four golems, one for each of the party members. The leader of the golems steps forward and says simply, "If you want to get to the REAL final room, you must best us."

Because he didn't attack immediately, one of the players asks if this is like Death from Bill and Ted, and that they get to choose the game they best him at. This wasn't what I originally planned, but I roll with it. They all start checking their inventories, and the first idea was to use this magic set of dice the rogue had to play a rigged game of Yahtzee with them, but because they only had two, it was thrown out.

The players, at this moment, remembered their backstory. Their characters were street performers, living in the large city back on their home plane. They check their inventories and find that they all have musical instruments in some form or another (the dwarf made a drum kit out of the helmets of the goblins they had killed), and decided to challenge the golems to a battle of the bands. I can already see exactly where I want this to go, and the golems nod in acceptance of the challenge.

The illusionist's player in real life pulls up some song on Spotify, announcing that this is what the characters play. They all roll d20s to check how well they did, and it's pretty decent all-around. After a minute or so, I tell him to shut it off.

Lightning cracks across the sky as the earth splits open, from it emerging three guitars and a drum kit. I put on the [Guitar Hero 3 version of The Devil Went Down to Georgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89p8ya3ZdnQ), and roll for the golems. They take a commanding lead, and the adventurers are thrown off guard. The fighter, having some control over storm magic, attempts to sabotage the stone statue's performance, but rolls so poorly that it only makes them look better. They roll back and forth, neck and neck with each other, the rogue rolling nothing below a 17 on his lyre, nailing every solo.

Soon the energy surging forth from the duel is too much for the cavern to contain, blowing the top off the mountain. A storm is forming above the two parties, as the gods themselves venture down to earth to watch the spectacle. The adventurers begin to lose their lead, and are panicking and starting to think about what happens if they lose. Will the devil really take their souls?

Then, at the golem's closing solo, he rolls a natural one, breaking strings on his guitar. The rogue leaps in with his lyre, finishing the golem's part with a nat 20, causing the already broken guitar to explode violently. The rest of the party rolls, and one more of them rolls a 20, solidifying their places in history as the victors of this epic confrontation. The legendary sword they received from clearing the dungeon was nothing next to the golden fiddle that they earned. This went down in real life history and in world history as the best session of D&D we'd ever played.My friends and I started playing this year, and I got the lovely job of DM. It's tons of fun.

Well, the first session rolls around, and the players end up in town looking to get horses. They meet this one lady who apparently has a horse (her daughter's horse). Well, the lady's daughter is actually missing, so they go off to find her. Evidence shows that the daughter was taken by some sort of bird creature. They head into the woods, where they are attacked by a giant vulture. They just barely manage to kill it, then scale the tree it came out of, where they discover the half-eaten body of the girl. The party argues over what to do, with one person advocating leaving her, another advocating bringing back just the head (apparently she meant the head of the vulture, but forgot to mention this), and the others saying to bring her back. So, they carry the half-eaten body of the child back to her mother. As they approach, the lady begins screaming and crying with her grief, running up to them in hysterics. Of course, the first thing anyone says is the fighter asking her, "So can we get our horse now?"Not a DM, but a player.

After our first major encounter my character, the rogue, made out with a veritable fortune without the party really noticing - they were too preoccupied with their new magic items to notice my unassuming bag with more gold than it should have been able to hold.

I get back to town and decide I have enough money to stop my life of crime and really turn myself around (I wanted to go more towards Neutral Good for whatever reason) and told the GM I wanted to find a haberdashery and the 2 poorest souls in the town. 

He tells me I spot a guy so poor his loincloth barely covers his junk, and another guy who's so poor his loincloth doesn't even cover his junk.

So I go buy two pairs of breeches and coinpurses, put 10g in each coinpurse and attempt to reverse-pantse each of the poor dudes.

The first one catches me as I'm tying the belt on and chases me off before realizing what I was doing and thanking me profusely.

The second guy, though.

The second fucking guy was so out of it that I managed to get the pants on, tie the belt, and make it a block away before he noticed what happened.

The whole marketplace hears, "OH MY GOD, PANTS!" shouted at the top of his lungs.

Later in the campaign after an cosmic magic anomaly teleported us about 300 years into the future, we encountered a really strange church.

The Church of the Benevolent Breeches Benefactor.

Our entire group was rolling on the floor laughing our asses off.

EDIT: and the comment above this one is by /u/captainmagictrousers . Coincidence?
Edit 2: nvm Edit 3: Now he's below meParty was leaving a sinking ship. The Paladin and Wizard were still on the ship as the lifeboat was descending.

Wizard casts Feather Fall. He lightly descends to the boat.

Paladin just jumps. Covered in heavy metal armor, he breaks through the lifeboat and sinks straight down.

Lifeboat does not float with new massive hole in it. Entire party drowns.Not the DM, but in one of our recent campaigns, we had to blow up an ancient fortress garrisonned by troops of the evil regime. We stroll up to the front gates, and I make a bluff check to convince them that we are termite inspectors. *Stone* termite inspectors, which is why the garrison was in danger! I succeeded, and they opened the gates, lining up for uniform inspection (couldn't have any eggs in those uniforms). Our party's paladin then rolled an intimidate check to make the soldiers march out with him, seeing as stone termite inspection is obviously very tricky. He succeeds, and marches all 40 troops (which would have been a very tough fight) out of the keep. 

The rest of the party finds an anvil of unmaking, which we strike, and the fortress is due to blow up in ten minutes. We rush out to reconvene with our paladin, who tells the troops that the inspection is finished. They march back into the keep, which promptly explodes, killing them all.As a player....

My character was possessed by an evil spirit and attacked the rest of the party.  They proceeded to knock me unconscious and carried me back to town immobilized and gagged to avoid the spirit attacking them/cursing them or whatever.  They go to the local temple, explain that my character is possessed and ask for a purification ritual.  The local priest nods and says for a modest donation they can certainly help.  Cash changes hands and the party watches in horror as my character is burned at the stake surrounded by chanting priests and townsfolk.  

My brother is running a campaign where there's a real danger that players can go insane (madness). On a recent session, he rolled randomly to determine the madness for a player and rolled "compulsively eats feces". They were fighting trolls at the time, and whenever they killed a troll, he rolled to see if the trolls shit themselves when they died. One of them did. And trolls are large creatures, so they shit a lot. Dude dove in like a starving man at a banquet. I have plenty of stories!

Our Dragonborn Fighter got possessed and was attacking the Rogue and Druid. The rogue informed me that he wanted to target the fighter's shoulder to "dis-arm" him. Well, he rolled a critical, so that's exactly what happened!

Then, the fighter was helping lift a giant stone slab off of the druids legs, and it fell, crushing his other arm...twice. So, now he is completely armless. Good times.

After that, the druid became a centaur and accidentally killed a prostitute, due to his new ...anatomy. He also slept with an owlbear , which was commemorated with a tapestry. Unfortunately,  he developed a drug problem and ended up committing suicide via overdose. That session got a bit too "real".

The party really wanted epic mounts, so I set it up where there was a home brewed monster that was carrying babies in its pouch. Well, they killed it, and before looting the body, the druid hit it with lightning, bye bye mounts.

In a past campaign, we were carrying a mirror that traps whatever being that looks at it inside of it. Well, we forgot to cover it up.. We were  on the second floor of a building, and a drunk man ended up getting sucked in, so we released him without thinking. He fell out of the window, breaking both legs. So then I used prestidigation to make his hair taste like bacon,  which he and his friend  really enjoyed. Our dungeon master had us role for dick size (hard & soft), I rolled an 11-12... I was a short elf. He used to make me role to see if I passed out when beautiful women entered the scene. I was DM a game with my wife and another couple of players.  They had just finished a dungeon crawl and were staying in an inn between adventures.  
I decided that when they woke up they found that everyone in the inn other then them had been killed in the night, and as it was morning the towns folk were outside and would be coming in for breakfast soon.
This resulted in one guy(fighter) in a falsetto trying explain through a door that they were out of food, another player (Elf-ranger) rifling pockets for gold, and my wife (Dwarf-cleric) stole a keg of ale and all the pots and pans.  They then jumped out the back window and were chased out of town leaving a trail of cookware in there wake.
I wasn't DM, but I ruined an entire run by stealing some stripper's coin from the stage and punching the bouncer. We wiped. We wiped hard. [This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4gnv4s/story_the_random_encounter_of_a_lost_boy_aka_ive/)Not a DM but a player.

Last semester our group started playing 5e for the first time. We had always played home-brew before and decided to try something more official. So we make new characters and start out. Well one of the first quests involved clearing out a rat infestation in the local general store. So our group of 6 players goes in and gets utterly annihilated. We manage to pull out a win with two players left conscious against about 6 rats.

After the fight the DM looks down and just starts laughing. He was using the stats for a giant snake rather than a rat. Instead of a level 1 encounter it was a level 3. A bard in our party decided to write a song about it and rolled a 20. He spent the rest of the campaign regaling the countryside with the "rat-snakes" song.Introduced a character named Helrhud Harmhung. He was a 3.5e ninja who was pretending to be an illusionist wizard. He called himself a "psycho-illusionist" because all of his illusions only appeared inside the minds of his enemies instead of to everyone. He would stand at the back of the party during battles, mumbling and using bluff to make it look like he was casting spells. I purposefully pronounced his name differently every time: Halrood Harmhang, Hulrud Hrumhung, Hilrhid Hormhing, etc.

Eventually, one of the players finally passed their sense motive check and knew he wasn't casting spells. He had no real idea how to refer to the character though, so he just yells out "Hey- hey GUY! Stop pretending to help and actually help!" The NPC yelled at another player, thinking the first player was referring to him instead.Well, there was that time a bunch of D&D players showed up because they misunderstood the term Dungeon.I posted this a while back in r/dnd, but it's a fun story, so here it is again:

Back in 2E (When it was AD&D), I had an RPGA character I min/maxed with point buys, so he had an 18/00 STR and a 6 INT. It wasn't as obnoxious as it could have been because the group I was in was more interested in having fun and seeing what kind of crazy shit would happen, so we didn't see stupidity as much of a hindrance, if we were able to make it entertaining. He was a guardsman, and meant well, even if he was dumber than a sack of hammers.

Anyway, we were after a thief that had some important information, and he slipped out of our trap and started running like his head was on fire and his ass was catching. Me, thinking quickly but speaking less so, meant to say "I grab the nearest rock and throw it at him," the idea being to knock him out, or at least over, so we could catch up.

Unfortunately, that wasn't what I said. What I actually said was "I grab the nearest thing and throw it." Which just happened to be our thief. Who was a halfling.

I immediately shout "ROCK! I meant nearest ROCK!" It was too late. Since I had a 6 INT, the DM decided to roll with it and hold me to my word. He first made me make an INT check to see if I was smart enough to NOT grab the halfling, which naturally I failed, so the next step was the STR check, to see if I could pick him up and throw him, which naturally I succeeded, with flying colors. So he had me roll my attack.

Damn if I didn't roll a 20. I critted with a halfling. So the DM ruled that the crit allowed our thief to roll his backstab damage, which saved us the trouble of having to figure out base damage for a hurled halfling.Here's the story of my first almost-TPK as a new DM:

I've played D&D for a while, but a couple years ago I started DMing for a new group.  We were playing Age of Worms (3.5) and everyone was level  at the time.

The party consisted of:

* Human Paladin

* Gnome Illusionist

* Half-elf Rogue

* Elf Ranger

They had a cleric (obviously) but he couldn't make it to this session.

In one of their first sessions, they fought some enemies and discovered a damaged elevator shaft that descends 60 feet to another room (the elevator itself was destroyed).  The shaft is well-scarred by acid, and is therefore not difficult to climb (DC 5).  Here's what turned this innocuous transitory element into a near-TPK:

* The Elf Ranger decides to climb down the shaft.  He does not want to touch the sides of the shaft, so he uses an overhanging hook to secure a rope (which he fails to knot) and attempts to climb down.  He immediately rolls a 1, which gives him a 5 against a DC of 10.  He falls 60'.

* The Elf Ranger takes 15-odd damage (low roll by DM fiat), leaving him bleeding out at the bottom of the shaft at -5 hp or so.

* The Paladin freaks out at seeing one of his comrades wounded, and starts scrambling down the shaft.  He takes a -5 check penalty to move quickly.

* The Gnome Illusionist also begins to climb down, but more cautiously.

* The Half-elf Rogue is afraid and unwilling to climb down the shaft.

* While they are climbing down, the Gnome Illusionist fails his check by more than 5, and falls.

* The Paladin makes a reflex save to catch the Gnome, a strength check to hold onto him, and a climb check to hold onto the wall.

* The Paladin scrabbles down until he is 20 feet from the bottom of the pit, then jumps down (while holding the Gnome), seriously wounding himself (and the Gnome) but buying him enough time to stabilize the Ranger at -9.

* The Half-elf Rogue climbs down and makes a harness out of rope and cloth to cradle the broken Ranger.  They decide to have the Paladin and Illusionist pull the rope from the top while the Rogue climbs below it and ensures that it doesn't tip over or unravel.

* 30 feet above the floor of the shaft, the Paladin and Illusionist fail their strength checks and lose their grip on the rope.  The Half-Elf Rogue manages to break the Ranger's fall, but takes enough damage to drop himself to 0; he's disabled and can no longer climb the shaft.

* The Paladin and Illusionist climb down the shaft.  The Illusionist casts Enlarge Person on the Paladin, who hoists the Ranger over one shoulder and clambers up the shaft.  Then the Paladin climbs back down.  

* The Illusionist attempts to climb back up, but loses his grip and falls partway up.

* The Paladin fails a reflex save to catch him.

* The Rogue makes a reflex save to catch the Illusionist, and a strength check to hold onto him.  The strain causes him to pass out and he begins to bleed out.

* The Paladin stabilizes the Rogue.  The Illusionist casts Enlarge Person again and the Paladin hoists the Rogue to the top of the shaft.

* The Paladin climbs back down.

* The Paladin and the Illusionist climb up the shaft concurrently.

* The Illusionist fails his climb check for the third time.

* The Paladin makes a reflex save to catch the Illusionist, a strength check to hold onto him, and a climb check to hold onto the wall.

* The Paladin carries the Illusionist out of the shaft by the scruff of his neck.

* The Illusionist and Paladin put the Rogue and Ranger on makeshift sledges and drag them back to town.

This entire process took two hours, after which we called the session.  Nearly every character died at some point.  I fudged several rolls behind the screen, but all of the skill checks were made by the characters themselves.  *The only thing they did this entire session was attempt to descend the shaft*.

I almost had my first TPK.  Their only foe?  Gravity./r/dndgreentext  for a bunch of funny dnd related postsA player of mine fell asleep mid-game, usually this is fine, however he happened to be roleplaying the guy who was guarding the prisoner at the time. 

Needless to say he was robbed blind and the prisoner escaped.As a player:

We had just started a campaign and had been buttraped by a bunch of orcs. A female (this is important) character died, and so the priest of Cthulhu decided to see if there were any temples of Cthulhu in town. Turned out there was!

But resurrections cost. Like, a lot. Far more than a bunch of 1-3rd level characters could afford. So we sold stuff. We sold the characters bow, and her arrows, and her armor, and eventually her clothes. We were still short, but the priest of Cthulhu nailed a charisma check. We brought the body of the dead character into the temple, and laid her on a slab like altar in a dark and dripping room. The Priests of Cthulhu (the ones who lived in the temple, not ours) put on squid masks and began to chant a mystic spell to Cthulhu.

The Character came back to life. The player walked in from the other room (house rule for dead players).

Roughly what the DM said:

"You wake up naked in a dripping cavern on a rough-hewn stone alter surrounded by chanting men in long coats and squid masks."

The player just turns to all of us and says, "Goddamit."Our most recent campaign.  We're in an underground forge with a river running through it.  Friend of mine decides "fuck bridges" and leaps over the ~2ft canal to get to the enemies.  Fails.  Falls in the water and starts getting pulled by the current.  I put down my hooked hammer to help him get out, but the current pulls him to the other side at the last second.  Other party member tries to throw him a rope, and critically fails, throwing the entire bundle of rope *at* him.  He gets tangled in the rope and plunges over a waterfall, the rocks at the bottom kill him instantly.  He died as he lived - Cursing his only friends.

TL;DR: Friend jumps over a canal instead of using a bridge, dies.A paladin and a bard are interrogating an enemy general. They have a powerful npc wizard with them, so keep that in mind.
They are threatening the general for information and are having no luck. The NPC wizard tries being the bad cop. "If you don't tell us what we need to know, the bard will kill you and I'll bring you back to life to start this over." Instead of the bard, the paladin walks up and clobbers the general over the head with his mace. I had him attack and he rolled a nat 20. It slaughtered the general, breaking his neck, breaking his spine and knocking out all his teeth. The wizard was bluffing. He couldn't bring anyone back.My DM gave us a puzzle. My group literally threw rocks at it. It was hilarious. We are dumb. My players found themselves being indoctrinated into a demon summoning cult/schol. I figured they'd go in, chop up the bad guys, take some loot, and leave. But not my players! No, they wanted to talk things through. For it, they received a wonderful tour by a senior student, showing all of the facilities and features of the school.

They ended up almost joining, but they were subject to a test of slaying a pyrohydra as initiation. They escaped the test alive, but were suddenly disenfranchised with the whole thing. The straw that broke the cult's back was not wanting to accept their barbarian friend into the cult. 

They ended up freeing a shit ton a demons and raised a rebellion to take down the entire school. That let to them being arrested, which is another story entirely.I had my players fight a troll on a bridge (because I think I'm funny) and instead of attacking it, (because they think they're funny too) they told it a riddle. Nat 20 intelligence check. The troll got so lost in thought that they were able to waltz right past it and carry on. DMing for a group of friends years back, party of seven is breaking into some mid-range noble's house to search for some kind of evidence regarding the noble's allegiances for a larger metaplot. Two of the party go through all the trouble to actually acquire disguises and infiltrate right under the noses of the guards, two more use their roguish ways and some handy magic items to sneak in and cloak-n-dagger the thing. The last three decide the plan is Shock and Awe and bust in the back door during lunch time. The entire thing was utter chaos, but one of the best highlights of the event is when the warrior of the BNE team got split from his two partners by a guard unit showing up to the ruckus they were making, he took off as a distraction and lead them on a chase.

At the conclusion of the chase, he busts into a room and declares he's looking for the biggest thing he could hide in and throws out a search check. Rolls a 5. "There's several large armoires on the far side of the room that you think you could easily hide in." Good enough for him, full run across the room and slams himself in the furniture.

"And once the door closes, [warrior] then finally hears the confused chatter of all the off-duty guards wondering who the hell just kicked in the rest hall door and dove into their laundry, along with the sound of a few dozen swords being unsheathed."

They tried getting in there to attack him, but he was pretty good at holding the door shut, and trying to break open the heavy wooden closet wasn't going so hot, so the guards basically put in group effort to tip the thing over onto it's door and just left the warrior trapped inside, tangled in laundry and linens. The party later had to jailbreak him and skip town because they'd bungled so much of the investigation they were doing, they got the powers they were supporting ousted and the competition was not pleased with the skullduggery they'd been subjected to. They never did get their fugitive status dealt with.So, this is a game-specific situation and event (My gaming group is currently campaigning through Edge of the Empire-- for those not familiar, it's basically Star Wars DnD). I joined the group late and wound up playing a sort of Paladin-type character if we're using DnD metaphors who really, really enjoyed talking things out before fighting. The rest of my group? Not so much. They also really enjoy breaking the game as much as humanly possible. Every opportunity, someone gets their face taken off with a vibro-axe while I apologize to their children. So we're playing through the Jewel of Yavin quest, which basically takes you on an adventure/heist around Cloud City. However, my group decided that, rather instead of completing the quest, the best possible solution was to blow up Cloud City. So that's what they did. And it worked. Much to the shock and dismay of our DM, the rolls went right and somehow, we wound up blowing a hole in the bottom of Cloud City, which meant that for the rest of the campaign, as we were trying to escape with this jewel and everything, there was a giant, smouldering hole in Cloud City. 
    
TL:DR; my gaming group murdered Lando Calrissian and I cried. I was running a heavily modified version of a pretty Lovecraftian module once and told my friends to make characters about two levels higher than normal. I wanted this to be a reverse Lovecraftian, silly, wacky wild game.

Boy, did they fucking deliver. We had one Tibbit Psion named Sir Fluffington III, one Half-Ogre Half-Minotaur luchador, one bearded lady Warlock, and one very, very inept sorcerer. All of them were very independently Evil.

At some point early on, they found a cave/temple with a few cultists. The party *mowed* through them, beat them unconscious, stripped them naked, tied them up, and threw them in an Enveloping Pit.

Once they cleared out the underground area, they proclaimed that this area would be their base. Oh boy.

They went along with the general plot of the module for a while until they got to the asylum. Their eyes went wide and they shoved just about every crazy person they could into the bag. They found the duergar surgeon/torturer in the basement. I thought they'd fight, but they ***offered him a job***. 

What job?

"Run our sexy, sexy torture dungeon. It's how we make money to please our god, Sir Fluffington Snowball III. Rub his belly."

All he asked for was a fresh set of adamantine tools and a few slaves to have fun with.

The duergar pointed them to his former boss. The minatogre luchador ran in, got glitterdusted, blindly grabbed the wizard by the throat, and squeezed until he popped.

On their way out, they ran into a room with a chaos beast. The Tibbit Psion charmed it and sent it into the bag.

The bag full of prisoners.

Yeah.

They were going to sell fucking chaos beasts.

Later, the Luchador triangle choked a Shoggoth to death, skinned it, and made a new outfit out of it. In response, the Sorcerer blinded himself and was put on a leash.

This game was going to continue with a war against the local church, but schedules got in the way.

u/knife_music was the luchador. Too powerful. Really fucking fun.I wasn't the DM, but a buddy of mine made a whole in the wall of a cave and fucked it, because the DM trapped him there.The four of them had almost killed a dragon and, after rolling a one, the Orc spells word cut his leg off with a sword that we refer to as "raging erection"As a DM, probably the time I was running a superhero game, and one of the players everyone hated wanted his character to have the power to be buttery. Eventually a giant super strong monster squashes him, and the buttery guy was spread all over the fight.

Two of the players decide this is a great opportunity, collect him up in a bag, heat it with their powers and consume him over popcorn.

That same player has accounted for more deaths in my campaigns than every other player combined.

Off the top of my head, he was run over by a van filled with other PCs horrified by his cannibalistic dinner parties, falling thousands of feet to his death a couple times, killed by the Pope, sent out of an airlock, consumed by vampires, and eaten by a land shark.I was storytelling my first game of mage the awakening in high school.  We had, shockingly, an almost equal number of gals and dudes and we were playing a scenario which was basically just a Magic version of our actual high school.  For the most part I let the players decide where the plot was going.  

At one point all the gals decided that they needed to get ready because prom was coming up for their charcters, so their characters went dress shopping.  Which one of them botched, she botched a dress shopping roll I shit you not.  So what do I,  a dude GM with no idea what a dress shopping fail looks like.  We'll fortunately earlier that year Jennifer Lopez wore one of the agrees upon, worst dresses of all time.  So that's what she ended up buying an exact replica of that hideous dress.  Which all of her female friend PCs then tried to be supportive of and told her how nice she looked.  I wish I had been present to play this one: [How to set up a contract to fuck your players over.](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3n8zmn/strange_request_help_writing_contract_for_hiring/)I've had a group who made a point to get into a physical altercation with every npc. Ended with a mob of townsfolk killing them. Had one where they made it pretty much all the way through the campaign, little did they know the one rogue in the group had been stealing from all of them the entire time in secret, and then dipped out on the final boss with the pendant necessary to beat it. One campaign ended with the group siding with the antagonist and helping him take over the city because I made him too cool, and they all wanted to see what happened. After they helped him and he turned the entirety of the village guards into mind controlled puppets, he killed them all. I was playing with some friends. We were short a guy this session, but we played on. We had been playing for a couple hours when someone suggested we make a quick Walmart run for food. So, we run down to Walmart, get some Red Lobster biscuits, Mountain Dew, the likes. We go back home and begin playing again, however we are having a somewhat difficult time staying on task for whatever reason. The DM was trying pretty hard to move things along, and eventually we are able to get through a mountain and into a new forest. 

In this forest we find a mountain sized pile of goblin corpses, with a shadowy figure in a cloak standing on top. We yell to him, he turns around, removes his cloak. Suddenly, our DM and another voice from behind all of us say "BYORK!" At which point we all look back to see someone come out of a closet with a sword. It was Brian, THE GUY WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT THAT DAY. He had snuck into the closet while we went to Walmart, and hid there for 2 AND A HALF HOURS. The first thing he said after coming out was "I'm so hungry and my phone ran out of battery 15 minutes in."Making my players deal with halfling mobsters in my eberron campaign.  Of course they all talked like they were from jersey.

Mobster: I oughta box yer friggin ears!
Player: Hah, you can't even reach my ears!
Mobster:(shrug) I gotta hacksaw.I am a DM/GM some of the time, but I was a player in this case (also not a very well-known game called Abantey):  
Our party was staying at a relatively expensive hotel preparing to go investigate something when we got attacked by some (very dangerous) people. After taking them down, we decided it would be a good idea to get the fuck out of that town as soon as we could. In Abantey, teleporting is not instantaneous and animals can get nervous and scared during it. Our party had a horse and a sabretoothed cheetah (don't ask). We had already been planning to travel, so we already had some drugs that would sedate them called "Mellow". In the context of the game, Mellow is literally weed. Well, we were about to leave when one of us realized a way to teleport without Mellow, which was unchanged easier. Coincidentally, we still needed to pay the hotel staff. We wound up leaving a five pound bag of weed with the hotel staff and booking it out of there.  
  
TL;DR Had to leave town, wound up leaving a five pound bag of weed as payment for a hotel.One time, I rolled to steal this majestic mountain dog from a man in a village we had just saved from a demonic wizard. I rolled just enough to get the dog but not enough for it to actually like me. From then on, whenever I rolled to pet the dog or engage the dog in any way, I would roll so low that it ended up hating the very fiber of my being. Eventually, it just had enough and ran away. One of my friends whose character was a gunslinger named 'Favre' (we're from Wisconsin) rolled to rescue and bring back the dog. He rolled a 20 and "brought the dog back purring in his lap while ahorse."

Edit: Obviously not a DM but a player.I was playing with a group of power players, so, being a bit of a troll, I rolled up a bard.  A true neutral bard who refused to fight at all.

Being power players and having a willing DM, this party literally killed a rogue demi-god, and, as a reward, were given any weapon in a god's armory.  I stated that I don't carry a weapon and was given a magical lyre instead.

The very next session was meant to be a bloodbath and to let glorious XP fall upon the heads of players, as the DM gave us  essentially an entire army of low level drow to slay.  I, being a non-combatant, climbed a tree and played my magical lyre, singing about the "great drow slayers" my compatriots were.  I crit the roll for intimidation.  The DM said to "roll for the percentage of the drow that immediately run away".  I rolled a 97 on a percentile.  And so, 97% of that glorious XP ran away from the party.  The party was PISSED, and my bard died shortly thereafter.I wasn't the DM but we were playing and going around a gypsy camp. The guy playing a giant was drunk and trying to get laid. You know it was for a couple of good yucks. Eventually he found a girl but rolled a low perception check. We take long rest after one of our gets gets hurt by a willow wisp. Everyone wakes up and he's told he was with an up fly old lady...with no more teeth. You can imagine what that implies. 
Also I was made larger by our wizard in one situation when we happened to be be in a small building. I kind of broke the building because I was already 7ft and a dragon man, the building was about 25ft tall I think. Not a DM but a Player.

(Possible spoilers for Rise of the Runelords)

In the first game i ever played, we came across a huge encampment of Stone Giants, we needed information, that we guessed would be somewhere in camp but with only four of us, there was no way we were getting that far by fighting.

So we came up with a better idea, there was a Blue Dragons lair on the other side of the valley we were in and we had a Pick that allowed us to tunnel way faster than we should have been able to.

We tunnel under the giants, and come up right outside the dragon's lair, stealth check to see how far we need to go inside the lair to get to the dragon's treasure pile, (full of coins, and luckily the dragon was sleeping on it) then we tunnel the rest of the way until we are directly under the pile of coins.

At this point, Our Wizard turns into an earth elemental and takes all our bags of holding, opening them in turn, just beneath the gold pile, so the gold begins to flow into our bags of holding.

The dragon wakes up, doesn't realize we are there or that we even exist and thinks the Giants must have somehow done this. So he flies out and starts shooting lightning at the giants until they finally kill him, and we use the confusion to sneak into the Giant's underground base.

And then there are all the times my character nearly fell to his death. Gravity almost killed me more times than anything else. One time, because of a flubbed teleport roll, I appeared about 2 miles above the ground, fell for round after round, only to be saved 10 ft from the ground by our Wizard Dimension Dooring me to safety. I though i was a goner for sure that time. I was running a modern gang game, and I told my players that their notorious actions were getting them serious negative airtime on Fox News.  Their reaction was to storm the studio, kill a bunch of people, and broadcast their own rather threatening message.

There was also the time they chose a remote-controlled armored bulldozer as the tactic of choice for breaking some allies out of prison.Well you see it was the DM and I and one other player. We killed a giant ogre named Shrek and well it got BAD. My friend wants to loot the ogre body and take his twin globes as a prize. I said it was a bad idea and we'll he got a 1 on the d20 for a critical fail. I thought out loud "well he got a critical fail so it would be hilarious to see him fall into the ogre twin globes" the DM was like plz no but accepted the comical issue at hand. He fell face first right in and after having withdrawn himself he vomited everywhere and passed out. My character had to do a will save to not vomit from the stench and failed naturally. In the end my friends in game character was unaware that I used his robe as a vomit cloth where I wiped my characters mouth.Not a DM.

We're a group full of melee characters. Somehow when we were discussing who was playing what, the druid (me) skipped over him being a shapeshifter, the ranger skipped over fighting with claws and a bite, and the wizard skipped over playing a summoning build, in which he summons multiple other melee dps.

So, one of our first bosses is this lady who flies around. Go figure. None of us know what to do, so the druid turns into a giant bat, the monk climbs on top of him, and they fly into the boss.

Monk jumps off and grapples her (he rolled a 20) and pins her to the ground, almost dying from falling damage.

**TL;DR: Monk rode on the druids back and jumped off to kill a flying boss**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Later, a dragon was terrorizing the town we were in and the encounter was basically 'deal with the things on the ground while avoiding dragons fire.' We decided 'Nah fuck that we're dragonslayers' and so the Cleric casts Air Walk on our barbarian, who sprints at the dragon. 1st attack, crit and knock prone. 2nd attack, crit and blind. 3rd attack, crit and do str damage. I wish we actually killed it, but we got it down to a few more health before it flew away blindly (even at half speed flying, my eagle form couldn't outfly it).

**TL;DR: Almost one shot a dragon**I threw a deck of many things in a chest and used their wishes against them like a djinn, Entire party wound up dead except for the paladin, who suffered a critical hit that permanently disfigured him and halved a bunch of his stats. Player, not DM.

My party had recently just got out of a dungeon and now we were in a town. The party split up to get various things we needed. I went to a blacksmith to get a death for my magical "has a small chance to kill whenever it touches anything" sword.

As I left the blacksmith, I was immediately pulled into hell. One of my fellow players decided it was a WONDERFUL idea to make a deal with a demon with the party members souls as collateral. Said player then rolled comically badly, including multiple ones, ending the game right there.As a player, my current 3.5 character is a holy monk with the sacred vows, but I rolled a 7 for intelligence.

He worships "Tire" the god of rolling justice. All of Tire's tenets are car maintenance guidelines. Recently, before going into a long journey I drank 4 quarts of oil and became violently ill. For some reason, the party lets me do all the talking, which mostly consists of me trying to convince bad guys to stop being bad guys, and misunderstanding things. The end goal of this journey was to fight the boss Shade of the dungeon we were in. He was named Siraxes, and I kept wanting to know why he was called Sir Axes if he didn't have any axes. The DM and I roleplayed this out for 15 minutes while the party came up with their battle plan.I've only ever been a player, but here's some stories

Our group has one player who likes to play crazy mages. In one of our campaign, we went into town, and split up. I was a LG monk, so I was out doing nice things for the villagers, but the CN rogue, the CE sorcerer, and TN (but very dumb) ranger discovered that almost all of the property in this town was mortgaged to the same guy. They proceed to have a heist to steal all the deeds. 

At the last minute, the owner gets back, and catches them all in the act. They jump out the windows, and run into the market, where they proceed to incite a rebellion to run that guy out of town. They then give the ranger the deed to the bakery so he can feed his doughnut addiction, and split the rest of the deed between the two of them. 

The sorcerer then proceeds to get drunk. So drunk in fact, that he starts dancing and the deeds that he's been hiding under his coat start flying out everywhere. Needless to say, the townspeople are pissed because they thought they had just run the banker out of town, and here's another one who now owns their houses, so they run the sorcerer out of town, so he tells them about the rogue and ranger so as not to be kicked out alone. They then chase out the rogue as well. The ranger got a pass because the sorcerer had previously chained him to his oven, and was thus unable to run him out of town. Meanwhile I'm just whittling little wooden statues for the kids, so the rest of the party can have the DM's focus for their big adventure.

Another story from later in that campaign:

We were getting antsy because we had reached the dragon, but weren't nearly strong enough to beat it on our own yet, so the DM gave us a deus ex machina wish to save our bacon. I took it and wished that the dragon had to do everything I told him to. At that point, we start debating about what to do with the dragon. I already told him that he had to be good, but he was still halfway stuck in the portal to hell (or whatever the D&D equivalent is, I forget). I'm of the mind that we ask the Jesus-like NPC to release him, but some of the party just wants to send him to hell anyway. Of course, the sorcerer is notably quiet during the discussion. We announce to the DM that we've made our decision, but before we can say anything, the sorcerer decides to channel his chaotic evil god to send "everyone" to hell and curse us to dance for the rest of eternity.

In our current campaign, he likes to summon his cat familiar and use it in unorthodox ways. He used it to detect where the gorgon was in the darkness. He used it as bait to distract vampire spawn so we could get away. He used it to detect hidden passageways by attempting to pull it from its pocket dimension inside a wall until it succeeds. He likes to throw it in enemies faces as a distraction. He used it to sound for the depth of a few holes, by dropping it and asking it to meow on regular intervals until it hits the ground. Every time it dies, his wizard is in tears, until he resummons it, at which point, the wizard has the utmost disdain for the cat again. Had a player try to climb into a dragon's ass because he critically failed his perception check.The funniest situation I was ever in -- in retrospect -- happened in a Star Wars D6 game.

We were a band of pirates and were actually sneaking around in the Emperor's palace, or one of them.  We were assured by our contacts that no one important was in residence and we were only looking to snag some data to sell.  Get in, get it, get out.

We get totally lost in the humongous building and ended up in one of the state "throne rooms".  By luck we discover a secret panel behind the throne and stumbled on a cache of highly top secret info.

Just then my force sensitive gets a vision: guess who's in the building with us?  The GM did an amazing impersonation of Darth Vader's breath mask.  The whole group of players just freezes in place.

Every group has "that one guy".  Our One Guy decides that setting the throne room on fire was a great diversion.  Just lovely.  Now all the alarms go off.


I have to remind you this is about 2 in the morning and we're all in a state of half-elation, half-exhaustion, and we were seriously into the game.


We panic.  We're looking for a way out, ANY way out, and all the while my character keeps getting these hallucinations of that labored breathing sound right behind me.  Finally the party comes out on a rooftop.  We run to the edge and discover we're about a bazillion kilometers up (this is Coruscant after all).

We turn around and in the distance we see Vader.  He's with a group of red suited troopers and just walking towards us.  He knows we're trapped and is in no hurry to capture us.

Now, the GM intended us to fight a couple rounds in terror, then have our ship and backup appear and whisk us away.


What happened is that we all looked at each other, joined hands, and jumped off the roof.

The GM had us so scared that we'd rather commit suicide than face Vader.  

As we had a way to fall I tried desperately to slow our decent with the force.  It started to work.  Then work too well.  Now we were going back up.

Vader was pulling us up!

Now I'm trying to push us back DOWN in a mad panic.

So here we are, using the force to yo-yo up and down the side of the emperor's palace.

Finally our backup arrived.  They shot at Vader with the ship's guns and managed to catch us as we fell.

Good times./u/AngryDM probably has some good shit.My party was being attacked by an ogre. Two of us were up a steep hill and the other, a half orc noble. Came around to sneak attack from behind. The ogre had just begun his ascent when our half orc came out behind him and attacked using bite. Due to the angle he was at he ate that ogre's ass to death.


Later on we're exploring a cave and come across the corpse of a beheaded ogre. We wondered if it was the same ogre who got a one way ticket to salad-tossing hell so we checked his booty. Our GM said, "you notice that his butthole is tore up!"[Basically the entirety of the Tavern of Taverns Campaign.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2itbhn/the_tavern_of_taverns/)

My group wanted to go full murderhobo in an Evil Campaign and I decided to indulge them.  Easily the best times I've ever had playing DnD.  A fun romp through a Mega Tavern in the Infernal Plane that is made up of smaller Taverns.  I posted this Once before. One of our PCs was playing a homebrew badger (will call him steve). The other was playing a chaotic neutral dickbag (will call him bob). Bob decides he wants to pee on Steve; Steve was not happy about this, so he bites off bobs penis and feeds it to our troll. Bob wants revenge for this so he tried to cut off Steves penis, but ends up tripping and castrating himself. I have never had something this crazy happen since.First game of a new campaign.

Players camp in a forest for the night while on their way to deliver a letter to a baron. They get ambushed in the night by a group of robbers. 

One of the players is completely new. He wanted a sword and board warrior. I helped him make a nice warrior built around using a shield. The first thing this guy does is throw his shield at the enemies (he fails the roll), missing and tossing his shield into the bonfire that the players had set up. He goes to retrieve the shield, plunging his unprotected hands into the fire. It burns him (a little punishment). He decides at this point that it would be a great idea to pick up a flaming log and throw it at the enemy. By the time his turn comes around, he has lost a considerable amount of health. He decides to pick up the log anyway, and attempts to toss it at the enemies. The rolls a 1 on his D20. The three damage he took was enough to knock him down. 

TLDR: During a bandit raid, newbie PC learns that touching the stove may burn you. Hope I'm not too late. Not the DM, but a player.

At some point the Druid made some homebrew diarrhea poison, gave it to the ranger. For a session or two, we all had the best time having the ranger shoot a kobold or something with a poop arrow, because then of course the DM would have to stop and describe a kobold pooping uncontrollably while fighting for his life.

We forgot about the poop arrows until one night we are in the middle of a really climactic encounter. The Bad Guys we'd been tailing around a town had ambushed us in an alley - having been outsmarted (not hard to do to this crew), it was now a hamfisted battle to the death. Ranger remembered the poop arrows, and thought that if the ringleader was distracted by unstoppable shitting, we'd have a fighting chance. Knocked an arrow and rolled a critical miss - managed to nick herself with the arrow and the poison, pooped herself down to 2HP.

We did  not win the fight.Had a sorcerer we ended up nicknaming "Haywire." He didn't roll very well and his spells would go hilariously wrong all the time, I think our DM just rolled the chance. So, story time.
Our party is in the local tavern, the bardbarian is drinking, Me, the priest, is chatting up a village elder. Now, Haywire is attempting to cast Confusion on a barmaid so she leaves her tray of drinks for him. Suddenly a pinkish green smoke just starts pouring from Haywire's hands and the biggest barroom brawl ever erupts. Everyone is rolling for will saves except the Bardbarian, who draws his sword and charges into the fray. Luckily, I made my 2nd will save and was able to cast Calm on him before he murdered any of our party. The rest of the bar wasn't so lucky. We left that town quickly.
The first time I ever played the roll of dungeon master, I created a mystery. My players were given a quest by a shady member of the King's Guard, the head of intelligence. He asked them to find the kidnapped prince of the land, and in return he would pay them a hefty sum of gold, in addition to nullifying the bounties on their heads. 

There was very little information on the prince or his location. The prince's last known location was at home of his tutor, a liberal philosopher by the name of "Burns." After brutally slaughtering all of his guards and killing his lover, they found out that Burns knew nothing, and could only tell them that the Prince enjoyed taking the backstreets back to the castle. After following his trail and beating a drunken hobo senseless, my players heard a rumor that the prince had been kidnapped by bandits, and taken to the woods. So, the players trekked out of the city and into the woods.

After hours of hiking, the weary travelers came upon a clearing in the woods, filled with bandits of all types, listening to a speech from a man on stage. His eloquent, soothing voice drifted through the woods, and convinced my players that he was surely the Bandit King. He spoke of killing the royalty, and my players figured that the prince was to be executed! Our ranger readied his bow.

I quickly asked "Would you like to roll to get a better view?" He declined. I replied "Are you absolutely sure?" The Ranger rolled to attack, got a critical, and fired.

The prince fell dead in the middle of the stage, halfway into his monologue about conducting a democratic coup along with the rest of Burn's students. He twitched on the wooden platform one last time before shitting his britches, and fading into the darkness. My players were subsequently hung for high treason. I wasnt DMing, but in the WWI style game I am in one of my teammates and I were hunting down Goblin politicians in their capital (my character has a grudge against the Goblin government). We come across a fancy bar, like a cigar and whiskey type place, and we go in. We obviously standout as tall Elven men but we still sit at the bar. 
After a moment we find the man we are looking for. Out of game we give each other a look like "Dude, I have a bad idea" "Dude...me too." So we start faking a lovers quarrel in the middle of this bar. Everyone is looking at us and as it begins to escalate we draw our weapons (my sniper rifle and his shotgun). At this point the whole party and DM are losing it as we are having this argument. A few seconds pass of yelling when we both point our guns at the target and just Tarantino style melt this guy with bullets. It was hilarious.My friend and I were battling skeletons wielding axes, pretty typical. My friend attempted to disarm one of the skeletons, and rolled so well that the skeletons entire arm came off. The skeleton then picked up his detached arm and rolled three twenties in a row, beating my friend's character unconscious with the arm she chopped off.As with so many submissions here, not a GM but a player....

It was my college gaming group, and we were a group of science majors - a couple physics majors, some math majors, and a comp-sci major. One of the physics majors (call him Zach) was playing a mage, and was getting bored with the campaign.

While the GM is describing whatever the scenery or whatever was, Zach says "Hang on a second. When I cast Fireball, it's energy coming from nothing. If I'm able to create energy from nothing, what's stopping me from creating enough energy to, like, destroy the moon or something?"

Another physics major says "Well that would depend on the binding energy of the moon. How much energy are you able to create?"

One thing led to another, and we ended up calculating the energy required to make every spell in the manual, and figured out that there is, in fact, a spell with enough energy to blow the moon into smithereens.

And that's the story of how we blew up the moon.

What's extra funny about it is that the next campaign we did, the GM described the planet as "a planet with a new set of rings that people are only just becoming accustomed to."Not a DM but in the middle of my first campaign ever. I'm playing a fighter, and after we realized that the ninja of our party was ridiculously overpowered, the player decided to retconn it, and we wrote a new character into this campaign. The new character is a half elf druid, who is, shall we say, extremely protective of nature. At one point in the campaign, the summoner of the party and i were journeying into the nearby forest to find the druid's grove, and on the way we ran into some lizardmen. My character, being the brash unwise fighter he is, was very aggressive and one fight later, there are some dead lizardmen and a tree with my trident stuck in it. The druid was not happy with this, and after some uncareful words from my character, the druid stabbed me into unconsciousness. Upon regaining consciousness, i went back to attempt to make peace with the druid, but fell in a hole instead. I woke up with a crystal embedded in my arm. (Crystals have been a large MacGuffin in this campaign) Rejoining with my party further down the road, the druid casts "detect magic" in a room full of loot, and notices the crystal, warning me about it. I waive it off, aggravating the druid even more. Later down the road, the druid is an owl, for some unbeknownst reason, and we're fighting a liquid stone statue. As the statue dies, it starts to explode, and the crystal absorbs the heat energy and fires it out of my hand, damaging the summoner, and knocking the druid (still an owl) unconscious. The summoner heals the owl, and the party comes to two realizations, 1: he's still an owl. And 2: The druid would not be happy with what the aforementioned crystal caused. This resulted, in the owl attempting to claw the crystal out of my shoulder, me grappling the owl, holding it out in front of me, and talking it down. If you didn't know, when druids are in Wild Form,they can only make the noises the animal they are can make. So i was talking very calmly and logically to this owl, whilst the player RP'ing as the druid was screeching at me. WE still don't know why he was an owl either.


TL;DR: I yelled at an owl, owl yelled back.Honestly this just requires a shoutout to /r/DnDGreentext/

Search by top. [One of my recent favorites](http://imgur.com/jexiU55)Not my story, but one of a friend of mine who happens to be the DM for another campaign I'm in.

So the group eventually comes across this really annoying gabby goblin. He's not hostile to the players or anything, doesn't give them any penalties or spoil their plans, but he's just a pain in the ass. Problem is, there's a paladin in the group who cannot abide by murdering an innocent being. So they had to deal with this really annoying goblin messing with them and tagging along.

One day, the group decides they've had enough and catch him in a bag of holding. They fill it with a few days worth of rations and some water, then sell the bag to an unwitting merchant in a town they were passing through. 

A few sessions later though, after clearing out a dungeon, they find a bag of holding among the loot. Upon opening it, the goblin pops out and declares "THERE'S NO LOVE IN THERE!"I fucked the herald of Calistria, losing my virginity to her after a drunken game of strip poker and getting the paladin girl naked, who would eventually become my wife and queen of the nation I was from, as I had killed my parents including my mother who became an evil dictator and turned into a drow, so once they were dead, I took over.

I then united the country with the Drow nation, as I had spent time undercover there and become the royal tailor to one of the main ladies of a very prominent house. I was both a king and the most famous dress designer in the area.

This was after we saved the world from a giant meteor.This made me laugh so hard I teared up and snorted at work:

http://imgur.com/gallery/J0VqHI wish I had a group to try DND with feelsbadmanHere are a few:

One of my players ended up starting the game with a pet guinea pig. During the first fight he threw this small pet at a wolf who promptly ate it.  The player was shocked and distraught because Herbert had just been gobbled up like a furry snack cake. One of the other players remarked at how it was still a monetarily sound move. A guinea pig costs just a single copper and so it was literally using up an enemy attack for a single copper and that was amazing.  The other players imediately started discussing the worth of a single attack in Herberts.

Within minutes a new exchange rate was born The KilaHerbert. 

Second:
My players had slaughtered a village/camp of gnolls but they couldn't bring themselves to kill these two baby gnolls so they put them in a backpack and started carrying them around like pets.

After a couple of weeks (after that first game session) they ended up coming out of a cave and climbing along a cliff ledge they fall into a river below.  Since none of them had bothered to get swimming they didn't fare very well but were able to make it to the other side.

Two days later they are looking for food in their backpacks and I inform them they find the rotting bodies of two drowned gnolls. Poor Jack and Jill.

Third: 
The players had been broken out of jail by a mysterious benefactor who wanted them to go up to a cave in the mountains where they would find instructions and crates of items to be used to waylay a group of assassins from their goal of killing a ambassador.

They arrive at the cave to find boxes and crates of magical gear and a large oiled leather wrapped tome.  They immediately picked up the tome and tossed it aside to crack open the crates to see their tools.

Within 15 minutes two of them had died when they they had sprung a trap of Evard's Black Tentacles and one had drunk 5+ random buffing potions to "see what they would do". 

Later they complained that they had no idea what was going on, I responded with "You didn't even stop to read the directions that were sitting on top of the crates!"  They said "That pile of oily leather!?!?"
Not a DM, a player

After defeating a bunch of goblins and taking one as our prisoner, the wizard asks the DM if he can make the goblin his familiar. DM says he cant. So the wizard rolls to bluff to *convince* the goblin that he's a familiar, even though he's not. It works. The party then has a collective pet goblin.Player, not DM. 
My fist campaign. Playing a human paladin with a base strength of 19. When I first met my parter, a gnome rogue, he tried to pick my pockets. So I punched him. In the face. And critted. And killed him instantly. We were less than 10 minutes in. (The DM took pity and resurrected him.) Later in the same campaign, we killed a guy, who was at full health, by kicking him in the balls.I was running a stargate game, and one of my players lassoed a bear-like animal to pull another player out of a hole he'd gotten stuck in. Somehow, the rolls all came out in their favor.
Party member wanted to hug another party member. Had her role for it. Long story short, they were all dangling off a cliff.Player here, not DM. My first ever campaign included dying, reviving and dying again. It also included smashing a Swedish cart drivers head with battering ram. He didn't die at first, surprisingly, but he did receive severe head trauma. He was basically a walking vegetable. It was hard to watch. I eventually ended his misery with a point blank arrow to the head while he was watching ocean. After that we went to into a cave and I was tricked into decapitating my partner by a demon and then I was killed by the same demon and that was that. The old man flying around shitting gold bricks on everyone while we were trapped in a nightmare within a dream bubble because my wife wanted to make friends with yet another creature I purposefully created to main and or kill a teammate. Thankfully we found that needle to pop the bubble after we found the special sandwich in the center of the labyrinth...tho nobody got to take a bite because my wife kept trying to get her new pet to eat it and it ended up running back home, the sandwich I mean, not the pet..My players were in a semi hostile vampire mansion. They tried to get laid. One succeeded. One ended up almost bleeding out after getting stabbed in the groin.Running a campaign, players get to a land they are unfamiliar with that they do not speak the same language as the PCs. The power gamer of the group thinks oh I'll just use my knowledge languages and then be able to communicate. Sure enough he critically fails and misinterprets the npc insulting him as a friendly greeting, proceeds to greet every native with this insult. Which amounted to get out of my fucking way you swineObligatory not a DM.

Dragon-born, half-ogre warrior with a large, talking, golden sword decides he wants to check a tower by poking his sword through a window and checking if he feels anything "squishy" (aka enemies). DM has him roll a strength check. He rolls a nat 20. Because he had poured most of his skills into strength, this meant he cut the tower in half, including one squishy. The tower falls and crushes an enemy building in their encampment. 

Later on, my character is controlling an arbolist. I see enemies coming through a hole in the back of the walled-off encampment, so I attempt to shoot an arbolist bow. Rolled a 1. Proceed to miss completely and destroy another building. 

Another character decided we needed a distraction, so they set another building on fire to cause a smokescreen. The fire spreads to another building. 

Pretty sure there were 0 or 1 buildings left after that encounter, and we didn't get to loot because we were chased out by backup.Not a DM but one time in a campaign one player was a drunk easily angered dwarf, it was one of his first times playing but he really got into the role. Even to the point of making ridiculous decisions just to screw up our elven comrades.

One day in particular we came to a town that was being terrorized by a magical Griffin I believe, this dwarf found out after trying to get a deal from the potion seller (that he failed miserably at I might add) that they made a magical type of potion from parts of the Griffin, the scales, feathers and even the refuse. 

So after a long day we finally manage to defeat this beast and the dwarf immediately decides to run to the nest and drag everything to town to sell to the shop. He tried again to get a good deal, arguing that since this was the last of the materials left they should pay double, but only got like 10 gold out of it and a potion. However on the way out he runs into the actual owner of the shop, an elderly woman, and decides to rub the shit he still has left on him all over her, after which he ran away after she called the guards. 

To this day we still fondly remember our exploits with Grognak the barbarian dwarf. Not a DM, but victim to RNGesus.  I got caught sneaking around a jewelry room of some sage's house by his housekeeper giantess.  I critical failed my diplomacy, then failed 2/3 of my item saves.  I came back in undergarments, a chest plate, with 1 arrow, my asshole enchanted bow, and 1/10 of my gold.What game are we even talking about?My job. I'm a farmer. My brain won't let me sleep past a certain hour. Sigh. So I just get up and make coffee and roll with it.My kids driving a fire truck across my face. 

EDIT: to clear the confusion, my kids are both under 5 years old and the fire truck in question is a toy. They are NOT fire fighters who drive an actual fire truck in or near my bedroom in the morning. My cats destroying everything I've ever worked hard to own in order to get fed at 5 A.M. When i get drunk, the next morning i tend to wake up early....And here we are.Once I got into the rhythm of waking up early, it just stuck. I used to be the opposite of a morning person, but ended up with a lot of jobs that required getting up early.

I mean, today is Saturday and I legit woke up at 5:30. Stayed in bed another hour because even for me, that felt too early for a Saturday, but I really could've gotten out of bed right then. I didn't fall back to sleep.The earlier I wake up, the more time I have to do stuff during the dayThere's a bird outside. Every spring him or his ancestors or whatever perch on the roof by the bedroom window. 

It's 4am FFS....quit your damn opera and let me sleep. 

If I don't show up to work, I'm legally thrown in jail. So. That. Being old. I'm 54. I rarely sleep past 7 AM. It just happened. I like it though. My wife sleeps in late and that morning time is my time. And you have more time to do stuff. Like on vacation when she's sleeping, I'm doing all kinds of stuff. When she finally gets up and says "What do you want to do today?" I'm like, I feel like the day's half over already.I haven't gone to bed yet.Gotta pee.I used to get up early because I loved the peace of the morning. Also I naturally woke up around 5 or 6am. Then I got depressed and now I could sleep all day The military. It trained me to wake up early to make it work on time. 

I've been out for 20 years, but I still wake up naturally at 6 AM.Grew up in a house with one bathroom. Fuck cold showers.I get up early because I go to bed early. I go to bed early because life is shite and if I go to sleep time will pass really quicklyThis will probably sound crazy or weird or whatever...  but, it's the truth.

I hate to get up in the morning.  I always have.  I fucking hate it.

However...

Six years ago, I married a woman who is so pleasant and wonderful.  The odd thing is that she likes to get up at 4 a.m.  She **LIKES** waking up at that time.  

She's pleasant and happy and is singing cute little songs.  Goddamn it, but I love to wake up to her and greet the day.  She actually makes me happy to wake up and get started - and it's all because she's so fucking wonderful to be around.

That's all.  It's just her.Once I'm awake, I'm awake. I can almost never go back to sleep once I've woken upIt's worth it to get a jump on the day. And to avoid traffic. Mostly to avoid traffic. I'm so excited for the day and what it will bring! The faster I get up/out of bed, the more time I have to get ready and get the day started!

edit: also because I'll panic if I get off of schedule and need to rush/skip things in my morning routineGotta walk the dog. But even he's asleep at 5am and has to be dragged outHave you ever drove down a highway all by yourself at 430 in the morning listening to some of your favorite tunes on the radio? It's therapeutic My dogs wake me up by 7:30 every morning.  They're the furriest, lickiest alarm clocks ever.I just got a night job again. Closing up and walking home as the sun rises is glorious.Planned to leave boyfriend's mom's apartment before his mom woke up. Went to leave at nearly 6 AM and she's already in the living room glued to the tv.  Later, I'll get a text saying she's disappointed that I slept over blah blah. What she doesn't know is that I sleep over almost every night and usually make it out before she wakes up *meh* Im homeless so i need to get up and pack up all my shit. Up at 430 or 5 daily Things to do.  Always things to do and none of them will get done if I'm in bed.I'm up at 5:20 every weekday, thanks to D.C. traffic and kids. Usually 6:30 weekends, thanks to kids.

When I retire, I plan on sleeping in until noon. Every. Single. Day.Hofstadter's Law

I've been up since 4:30am PST and the coffee *still* isn't done. Pour-overs are a bitch.I love mornings. I love the quiet. There's the freshness of a new day, the birds are singing and the sun is just starting to rise.  During the week I have to get up early for work but on weekends there's nowhere I'd rather be than the fields or woods behind the apartment, ankle deep in wet grass checking on what the wild animals are up to. There's a line in poem by Wendell Berry called 'The Peace of Wild Things' that goes "I rest in the grace of the world, and am free" and that's why I get up so early to rest in the grace of the world. I know it sounds corny and pretentious but I just can't stay in bed when the world is so beautiful.My prostate."MOOOOOM..."
I like sitting in my spot at the end of the couch, sipping coffee, reading reddit and the news, watching the sky get brighter and brighter out my east windows. And its quiet. And I don't have to hear my daughter watching those stupid fucking people-playing-Minecraft YouTube videos. The bus line outside my apartment starts up at around 5:15 in the morning. It's the first loud engine of the morning, and I can't ever get back to sleep. When it stops about a block away, I can hear the little beeps of the warning sound it makes as it's kneeling to pick up passengers. I seem to be able to get back to sleep after the street racers go by at 2 in the morning, and the motorcycles that have loud enough engines to trigger the car alarms of the cars parked outside. It's a shame I don't live on a busy street where there would be a constant hum of traffic as opposed to a car once every 5 seconds.the gym. I've successfully changed my routine to include gym in the morning monday, wednesday and friday. And it's not optional.Sausage. 4 week old newborn. Currently fussing around so he's going to want to eat soon.  My work requires me to wake up this early.The sun Usually it's my cat that wakes me up.I procrastinate and I end up not doing my homework until the morning it is due.Work. Habit I guess. I start work at 8, so I get up at 5:45 so I have time to get some stuff done before work.my dog. she licks my face every morning.I have to be at my school by 6:40 for my band stuffThe early morning was the only time I had the house to myself as a kid. Now being a morning person has just kind of stuck. I grew up as a paperboy, probably one of the last kid paperboys on the planet. I got up at 5:15 every single day and now I'm just an early bird by habit. There's something awesome about being up when no one else is, watching the sunrise and having that first cup of coffee while reading the paper

Edit: and by 'paper' I mean RedditMy body kind of just forces me to wake up at 8:00 and for the longest time I just kind of rolled over and tried to fall asleep. On days where I don't have anything to do I usually would succeed and end up sleeping until 12:00. Then I would get up and usually have to go straight into handling my responsibilities and stuff.

Cut to now. I still wake up at 8:00, but I realized that 4 extra hours in the day is so much time I'm missing by sleeping. I can handle all of my responsibilities after 12:00. I've been doing it for years. Now I just get out of bed and do something for fun. Walk my dog. Sit outside. Read. Reddit. Anything. These four extra hours are my favorite part of the day now. I don't have to really worry about anything. 

I think the biggest thing that changed me was realizing how much time I was missing. If I live 40 more years starting today I end up with almost 20,000 extra hours of my life just by waking up 4 hours earlier on Saturday and Sunday. 2 kids throwing up simultaneously!!!! Work...up every day at 3am. That trucker life.I'm not a fucking bitch The Military.

Trust me I HATE mornings but the threat of being late is even scarier than being up early. I wake up around 3 am every day, don't know why.  I go to bed around 8-9 every night, mainly because I can't wait for the day to be over, so I guess that's why I wake up so early.  I take meds that should knock me out and I fall asleep fast but I wish I could sleep 12 hours.  

I usually take Benadryl and Xanax during the day to sleep a couple of times just to make the day go by.  Yeah, I'm in a pretty depressed period right now, lost both of my jobs and have no friends and nothing else to do except work on my house, which I'm sick of doing, so I'd rather sleep.

So, I watch TV and sleep any way I can.I just wake up and can't get back to sleep. I haven't slept till my boyfriend's alarm goes off (6:30) in ages. Dream (AIM)CoffeeMy dog needs to go out.Coffee and the pressure of homework. And lerning for tests. And reading my book. And watching my series. And coding my game. And playing games. And the inability to sleep much longer, except on weekend, where I wake up 2 hours later.My room has windows facing the sunrise, and my blinds are shit, so during the summer I wake up at around 5. During the winter it is seriously taxing to wake up before 7:30.Ever since I was a kid, its been video games.  When I was young, it was diablo waking me up so I could get a few hours before school. Today, it is dark souls. Staring at my girlfriend's ass with the occasional grabI like to golf when no one is on the course. I like to fish just before and through the sunrise. It's the best fishing.

Dark Souls 2: Smelter Demon

Dark Souls 3: The Dancer 

Runescape: Dragon Slayer quest

Wow: Vashyr

Kelp. Fucking. Forest.Clanker's Cavern from Banjo-Kazooie.*Battletoads* The Turbo Tunnel  
  
The game is HUGE amounts of fun once you adjust to the difficulty. Few games are as skill testing as its 2 player mode.  
  
Want to find a good partner in some video game competition that gels well with you? You'll find out how well you mesh after a few rounds of 2 player Battletoads.Farron swamp in Darksouls 3, I can't stand the slow walking combined with the stupid poison.Favela level in MW2. The one where you hunt that dude down to torture. Absolutely horrible to do on veteran but not completely impossible.Scan the Keepers mission in Mass Effect 1.Every fucking level in Dead Space.

No game has ever scared me that bad.
Blight town. For those who like wading through shit and getting poisoned. Water Temple in Ocarina of Time.  Mind numbingly tediouslibrary-halo CE...  I didn't like the final boss level in Bioshock. It was too easy and felt out of place compared to the rest of the game.The level in Hot Line Miami 2 that I couldn't fucking beat because you are a soldier who has to kill a gazillion people who all have a clear shot at you. Fuck you Hot Line Miami 2 that level is impossibleEvery single water level.Feros in Mass Effect. It was a grand combination of being extremely long, having a very confusing map, and the fact that every colonist was useless and needed a favor.That hospital level in hotline miamiChapter 12 of Fire Emblem: Awakening. Up until this point most of the enemies you face are either foot units or flyers (who take massive damage from arrow fire). This level has you facing mixed amounts of cavalry and infantry, in groups of four or five units, and each group moves all the units that comprise it at once. Some of the knights are carrying anti-cavalry weapons, hampering some of the game's stronger units (Frederick, Panne, and Sumia come to mind). You do get a new character, Cherche, at the start of the map, and she does have a hammer, which is a pretty powerful anti-infantry weapon, but she's a flying character, so you have to be mindful of the enemy's mounted archers, who have a pretty long movement range.Atlantica. Especially in Kingdom Hearts 2. "Find the computer room"The clock tower in any castlevania game.The end level of dying light where you have to press the right button at the right tine or you have to restart the cutscene; eventually becomming a simple memory game that you have to repeat 29+ times The last level in Far Cry, where you fight dozens of mutants in an open field, and you have to do every movement just right. Played that level a hundred times to finally get through i think. I didn't lke the mutants as enemies at all.Frigid Outskirts in Dark Souls 2. Legitimately one of the most poorly designed levels in any game I've played. No idea why they thought that area was a good idea..The water temple in Ocarina of Time. I loathed getting to that part!Dragon age origins. The fade Chapter 14: Stairway to Heaven in Mafia 2 was a total fuckfest. The part where you're in the warehouse and they keep throwing molotov cocktails and never stop was the worst part. I haven't beat it to this day.There's a Mega Man game for PS1 and I think it's fun as hell till you hit snowboard levels. The one near the end I've never been able to beat. I just ran into the exact same kind of level on The Power Rangers Movie SNES game and now I can't beat that game.I love Battlefront II, but Operation: Knightfall on Coruscant can eat my entire ass.

OOPS THE ENDLESS STREAM OF JEDI DESTROYED THE BOOKCASES WHILE THE REST OF YOUR TEAM RAN AROUND IN CIRCLES, HOPE YOU LIKE DOING THE OTHER 3 OBJECTIVES BEFORE THIS PART ALL OVER AGAINMore of a "boss, if even that, but Twilight Princess - the stupid cart thing you have to chase and sweep bombs away from. Only part of that game I totally hated.Monstro in Kingdom Hearts 1. Fuck that level. Fuck that boss fight. Fuck you Pinocchio.The goddamn barrel in goddamn Carnival Night Zone in Sonic 3. Years I toiled, years I suffered until one day YouTube was invented and someone made a video showing how to get passed the barrel.Red Faction Guerilla, in the level where you have to blow up all those radio transmitters or solar panels meanwhile you have a bunch of the enemy vehicles shooting at you and running you over. It was also like, the fifth level of the gameDANCE WATER DANCE

DANCE WATER DANCE

DANCE WATE-

LOOKS LIKE IM FUCKING DEAD AGAIN THANKS TO THIS MULLET-WEARING NOBODY PIECE OF SHITThe hotel basement in The Last of Us. Fuck that place.Going through Pittsburgh in The Last of Us. I've played through it 8 times and every time getting out of Pittsburgh takes way too long. Fighting that one asari in Mass Effect 1 right before the rachni queen on hard difficult. Having to watch that cutscene over and over again with the same jarring music only to be frozen and bulleted to my grave made it one of the more frustrating levels I've played in a long time. Very last mission:
The Simpsons Hit and Run Where the hell is the bikes level from Battletoads on NES? That thing was freaking torture.In RDR (Spoilers I guess) after you basically get 90% done with one of the most badass campaigns that has you riding all over the west, Mexico, the mountains, etc, you get to do a solid 1 hr of farming / grunt chores work, and then play as an annoying kid. Like your reward for reaching the end of one of the most memorable story arcs I've played and being a major part of the dying out Western way of life is to get to play as Carl from TWD. Tubular from Super Mario World. Fuck that level. Crystal man: megaman 5... the falling crystals are fucking randomized above a death pit. it's hard Q~QEvery water or sewer level in every videogame sucks ass.I've said it before and I'll say it again. Bed. Of. Chaos. That boss can go fuck itself, and anyone who plays Dark Souls will understand the pain and suffering that boss is. To sum it up, you have to destroy two things by its side, and then in the middle, doesn't seem TOO bad right? Well once you destroy one of them the ground starts falling down and BoC starts throwing a fit and flailing around hitting you off, and its not even a "oh, ill just roll through it" because its basically a wall getting thrown around to the point where you can ROLL it but the collision will still throw your ass off the edge into oblivion. Once you get the second one down, fire starts erupting from the ground and you have to make a leap of faith onto a thin piece of wood that if you so much as mess up the jump by an inch you'll slide off the thing like a slip'n'slide and die, and even if you MAKE IT to the core of the boss it'll still erupt fire inside of there and wreck your shit, and if you die I'm pretty sure you have to do all of that again.This might date me a bit, but the cave level with the flying carpet in Aladdin for the original sega. It was such a fun game but that damn level was impossible. I don't think we ever beat it... And it might have been only the second level, lol, so many hours spent on that before we got nba jams and never looked back. I played dark souls like 7 times I've NEVER seen blighttown. 

All i ever saw in that place is naked spuder lady and the bell.Halo 3, CortanaAny time limit missions.I have a weird relationship with Dragon Age: Origins, almost every part of the game I'm like "ugh, this part is so tedious" but I fucking love that game.

Except the Fade. There's a reason one of the top downloaded mods just removes that whole section from the game.the malebolge in dante's inferno where you have to be airborne for 8 seconds, i was stuck for so longCatacombs of Carthus in Dark Souls 3. Similarly, Sen's Fortress in Dark Souls,

Every time I hear: "I believe that Aang can save the world" I get chills. Drake and Josh is a very underrated intro imoThe Addams Family.

I wore a jean jacket to school and got sent to the office and told I couldn't wear it because of the schools policy against outerwear which could be used to conceal a weapon. I made the astute observation that half the school were wearing great big hoodies you could hide a fucking howitzer inside of and, well, that was the end of hoodies at my school.Dressing up for halloween at school, someone dressed up as a dick.The name Adolf.Bin Laden ruined flying. 

The shoe bomber ruined shoes in security. 

That one idiot in high school who brought a water bottle full of vodka in high school, downed it, and got alcohol poisioning. Now people have to drink from the water fountain, and the vending machines don't have bottled water in them anymore.The dipshit that had to cry when he got pegged while we were playing fireball(aka wallball). We had been playing that game almost every day for three school years and it was so much fun. Shaun gets hit, cries, the game is banned forever and is punishable by suspension. The lady who got on top of a Galapagos tortoise at the breeding centre and rode it for fun. Now people aren't allowed to go inside the enclosure anymore.Osama Bin Laden ruined kids being able to see the cockpit of a plane. Like come on dude, that was the coolest part of the entire flight.The Fantastic Four was ruined by Trank and 20^th Century Fox.

Now I have to wait another seven years to see if they can get it right for once.Bill Cosby was ruined for everyone by Bill Cosby.That kid that got Pokemon card trading banned in elementary. Fuck you, Lorenzo.Stefen Fangmeier who directed Eragon wasted the opportunity to build the Inheritance Cycle into a billion dollar franchise. Ruined the story for anyone not familiar with the books.Shaylaman ruined the live action franchise of Avatar The Last Airbender.Gavrilo Princip tiped over the domino that lead to two world warsI used to work at a company that gave everyone free snacks that is until this one guy started taking an insane number of free snack- we're talking 10+ bags of doritos every day. After that no more free snacks. Isildur could have prevented Sauron's return and a big war in Middle Earth.Not one  person but an entire family.

In my elementary school there was a couple of kids who were I think Jehovah's Witnesses. One of them was in my grade. The school used to have holiday celebrations and the JW parents would come pick their kids up from the school on those days. Thing is they kept complaining about the celebrations even though they were taking their kids out for them, so eventually we didn't get to have them. They weren't even huge affairs to begin with, but every year they got worse until they just stopped them.[Reddit in russia](https://www.reddit.com/comments/3grpdf/)Whoever came up with the joke "What's the worst thing about rollerblading?

You're *not* the DM, Carl!!Well, this is a smaller scale "everyone" but this one guy in my high school always left the senior section of the lunchroom a mess, so within one month of the school year starting, no one was allowed to sit there anymore.

That kid also was the only senior not to graduate that year.JROTC can't use actual .22 rifles because some jackass wasn't practicing proper gun safety and shot himself in the shoulder. Now they just use air rifles. Caitlyn Jenner ruined being transgender. People won't stop asking me questions about her and act as if I have some sort of special insight into her behavior.That fucking shoe bomber guy made sure that we'd have to spend the rest of our lives repeatedly putting on our shoes and taking them off at airport security.I work as the front desk man in a condo building. Our housekeeping staff gets to live here for free. I, and all other desk-chair peasants, am banned from living here under any circumstances, all because years ago some fuckhole desk guy decided to shit where he ate and got himself fired and banned from the property with his reckless party animal behavior. I wouldn't want to live here anyway, but it chafes my ass knowing that his bad reputation is still influencing us years later.A few years ago, there was a site called highschoolmemes or something where you could upload memes for your specific high school.  I went to a private high school were every student was provided a laptop so it spread like wild fire until some people put up some memes about suicide and like really, really hateful stuff in general.

We ended up having an assembly that I unfortunately missed because I was at a math competition, but our head of school was apparently very "livid" to put it in his words.All these drone flyers who fly them too close to aircraft are really messing it up for everyoneThe didgeridoo.IIRC, some sort of shooting happen that involves a man wearing a hoody.

He as well as many other students were into Pokemon cards, and traded them every recess. Well this girl named Paige traded him a shiny Serperior without knowing it was a shiny. After figuring this out she cries to the teachers about how her cards were stolen and then proceeded to get the cards banned for everyone. Screw you PaigeMichael Moore ruined being fatIn primary school marbles got banned because some stupid kid who couldn't play for shit played keepsies, lost all his marbles, went and cried to his mom.Trump ruined reddit.A kid stole a slammer and we weren't allowed to bring pogs anymore.America by trumpRosie O'Donell spoiled the ending to the movie Fight Club for millions of people just because she didn't like the film personally.Me. The Game."This is how the 1% do Disney" 



That lady, God dammit.....Steve Jobs killed Flash, and single-handed set the Internet back as much as twenty years.

In order to ensure that Apple could collect 40% of all App revenue, much of which would come from simple ports of old Flash-based games, he claimed that Flash was too slow (it wasn't) and a security risk (it was, but no more than other systems), and thereby created the app monopoly we live under today.  If Flash had not been blocked 1 million Flash games would have been instantly available- free.  

And thousands of apps would have been available for nothing, bypassing the App monopoly entirely.  

It was brilliant, and illegal, and it worked.Kim Kar-fucking-dashion did a pretty good job of ruining TV.You don't have to be best friends with your roommate.Dude, don't skip classes (little as possible at least), keep a calender of some kind with all of your due dates, and enjoy yourself. * DONT TAKE 8 AM CLASSES
* make upperclassmen friends. They can give you better advice than strangers on Reddit--advice tailored to your university
* GO TO OFFICE HOURS (seriously). Professors are people too. 
* Don't bother to use your meal plan during welcome week. There will be soooo many events shoving free food to anyone who shows up
* Sit in the front of lecture (unless you want to see people's reddit/tumblr screens) 
* SHOWER. People can smell you 
* Don't wear your ID around your neck on a lanyard; it screams "freshman" Just go to class. 

You'll have the ability to sleep in or take naps without any input from anyone for the first time ever... Get your ass up for class. 

If it's early, wake up and go. Late in the day on a Friday? Just go. 

Even if you go and don't take notes, it's infinitely better than not showing up to class at all. Wear. A. Fucking. Condom. You aren't there just to learn the material. You are there to learn HOW to learn.

Network, that's one of the most valuable things you'll carry with you after school.

Make mistakes trying to do things better. 

Soak it in while having foresight to what comes after and be OK with not knowing what you do when you graduate. Make a business if possible. My friends and I have all either finished college or are in our last year. We've all said multiple times that we wish we would have gotten better grades our Freshman year. Sucks when the only thing holding down your gpa are the easy-mode classes taken Freshman year that you just didn't care about at the time. First week of classes go to your teachers office hours say "hi my name is ____ I just wanted to introduce myself and make sure I knew how to find your office." Now you have no excuse not to go ask questions later in the year. 
Find who is the department head for your major and see if they teach any of the low level into courses you need. If they do take that teacher. They will probably have bad reviews on rate my professor because they are "to hard" but they will be the ones teaching your hardest upper level courses and are getting you prepared.There's a few tips I learned during university:

* Study smart. Study the 90% you know is going to be on the exam. Don't try too hard to memorize details if you don't even understand the big picture. Some teacher/professors don't accept any other point of view, so learn their position and write what they want. Keep making note during the school year to help you with finals. It's not about the hours you study but about the efficiency.

* Don't get crazy on parties, but live your life. Your top priority is finishing college, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy yourself. Always take some time to go out with friends and relax.

* Explore your other passions even if they don't make sense right now. I really feel that having extra skills, even not related to your main profession, can help you stand out in a crowd of applicants.

* Powernaps are the shit. When you need to study more than 12 hours straight, take some 30 minutes powernaps to restore your concentration.Be social. It doesn't matter if that means going out to frat parties and getting drunk (hopefully safely and legally) or playing board games in your dorm's lounge. It sucks to graduate and realize you really have no lasting friendships.You're there to learn, then party.  Too many people got those mixed up and failed out.

Don't sign up for credit cards offered on campus.  They're predatory.

Wrap it up!  Every single time!

Make the effort to use a professor's office hours, and participate in class.  Not to *kiss ass* levels but enough for the professor to be able to know who you are.  There are 2 reasons for this.

  1. They will be more likely to write you a letter of recommendation for any number of opportunities

  2. If after exams, you're 1 or 2 points away from the next grade level, sending them an email asking if there are any additional extra credit opportunities they'll be more likely to offer a brief assignment if they know who you are, or quite possibly just give you that extra point.  I've had many C's turned into B's and B's to A's for this reason.
Get an internship. You'll be slightly better off looking for a job when you graduate college. Who knows? Your company might offer you a full-time position for being dedicated.Join clubs and organizations you are interested in. Socialize but work hard in your classes. Get to know your professors early. Volunteer. Develop healthy eating habits and an exercise routine. Actively work on developing your study skills (they have classes for these skills). Learn to budget. Study abroad for a semester. Take road trips. Do not drink and drive-not even once.* I would say to get very close to people who are going into your major. They will be your best assets down the line.
* Get prepared to lose 1/3 to 1/2 your freshman class. Some people major in partying.
* Jesus fuck do not procrastinate. It's not funny. Multiply the time you think it will take by five times. Get started on something early. Write the reports and do the powerpoints for group projects in advance, and have group members look at it and make tweaks to it.Go to class. Do your homework. 
Get consent. Use condoms. A lot of folks will tell you to focus on either your grades or your social life, depending on what their own priorities are (or were). Still others will suggest helpful studying practices, like doing your homework in the library rather than your dormitory. (That way, you develop the right psychological associations with each place.)

Objectively speaking, though, there are some more basic tips that trump all others.

------

**Always have a backup plan.**    
Whether you're talking about your course schedule or just preparing for those evenings when you'll inevitably be "sexiled" from your own room, you should always have some kind of contingency plan in place. It doesn't matter how seemingly mundane or certain a given outcome might be, either: You will *always* benefit from having a second option available.

**Keep an emergency supply of necessities.**    
A first-aid kit should be a standard fixture in your room, even if there's a resident adviser on your floor and even if there's a nearby medical office. Furthermore, you should maintain an adequate supply of non-perishable food and bottled water for those evenings when you'll need it (and you will). Just take care to purchase food that you'll eat when you're *hungry*, not when you're *bored*.

**Invest in a nice robe.**    
Someone is going to try to make popcorn in their room, and that person is going to fail miserably at it. The plumes of smoke are going to set off the fire alarm, and the entire building is going to be evacuated at 1:30am. Rather than being one of the fools who are stuck outside in nothing more than their underwear - and that does happen, you'll see - you'll want to be the smug and comfortable individual who laughs in the face of the cold from within your bundle of soft cotton and fuzzy slippers.

**Memorize the location of every administrative office.**    
People are going to ask you where the counselor, the dean, or the bursar are on an almost daily basis.

**Avoid that guy with the odd religious books.**    
He's recruiting for a cult, and he wants your money.

**Do not associate with the attractive girl who lives one floor above you.**    
You're going to start hearing her "evening activities" on a regular basis, and if you spend any amount of time with her - or, heaven forbid, even try dating her - you'll wind up with an incredibly stressful experience. Plus, she's going to get kicked out of the dormitory just before the end of the first semester, when it will be revealed that she had been inviting homeless men back to her room, offering them a shower and a pizza, and then sleeping with then. (The discovery will occur when a handful of those men show up again in search of more food and sex.)

------

College can seem like a daunting experience for someone who has never lived away from home before. Really, though, it's just like any other location, and the skills you develop there will last for a lifetime.

Besides, even if things go horribly awry... well, you'll have your backup plan, right?

**TL;DR: College tips for the alleged real world.**Dropping classes midsemester is a waste of your time and money.Don't buy all your textbooks brand new at the store right away. There are plenty of websites where you can find copies of them and check to see if your campus library has an edition on reserve. It'll save you a lot of money.

Edit: [Here is a good list](https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/hrgmv/tracker_with_pdfsebooks_of_college_textbooks/c1xrq44) of resources for finding textbooks online. I would also recommend archive.orgStudy hard. Make a schedule and stick to it. Don't procrastinate. Have fun, but not so much that your grades suffer. Meet new people and make friends. Be sure to have healthy outlets to cope with the stress, like exercise or sport. Get to know your professors, assistant professors, and teacher's assistants, because they're generally cool and knowledgeable. Eat healthy, drink a lot of water, and get plenty of sleep. If you have a crush on a girl or guy and you want to ask them out, go for it, because the worst they can do is decline. Take a lot of pictures so you have something to remind you of this window of time in your life. Make the most of every day you're in college, because the years you spend as an undergraduate will eventually come to an end, and you'll never get to have this experience again.Don't start studying for your tests the night before.  If you're living in a dorm, take advantage of your RA.  They are a great resource for learning about life on campus, events happening in the area, and cool extra-curricular things happening.  If you end up feeling anxious or stressed out, try talking to them about it as well - they are usually a good outlet for you.  Just remember, they are students too, and are dealing with a lot of the same pressures, just with a little more experience.  Be a good citizen of your dorm and a good person to your RA.

 Use Monday through Thursday to do all your homework, as best you can.  You're going to college because you want to get a job in an area you're interested in, so you may as well start now.  If you put in 40 hours a week doing homework and studying you're already ahead of the vast majority of your classmates.  If you do this during the week instead of procrastinating you have Friday and Saturday night to enjoy the social aspect of college without feeling guilty and trying to do everything on Sunday.

 Quit worrying about the inhibitions you had in High School - you are out of that social structure now and can be you.  Embrace it and make friends who value you for who you are.

 Join a club that interests you.  It's a great first step to learning how to make connections.  Make sure you don't overextend yourself though.

 Do not feel forced into college - if you have no idea what you want to do, you have some time to figure it out during Freshman year, but you will probably be better off waiting a year, exploring your options on your own time, and then going one year after highschool, instead of right away.

 If you live in the dorms, your RA will probably have free condoms and dental dams.  If you plan to be sexually active, take advantage of that.

 Go to the free concerts music students will probably put on at your University.  They are usually really, really good.  Better yet, bring a date!

 If you are at a University that has public transit near it, learn how to use it.  Knowing which bus lines go where and being able to help other students use them will net you some good street cred.

 Actively participate in the lame icebreaker activities your orientation or first week leaders put on.  Everyone is feeling awkward during them.  After you do that, feel confident starting conversations with people.  Ask them where they are from, what they plan to go to school for, what they do for fun, etc.  Drive the conversation and ask questions.  People want people they know around, so doing this early helps you build a good friend/support base for your start in college.

 Don't browse the internet during lectures.  Just watch and listen to the professor.  Sit in the front row - that helped me a lot.

 If you have extra space in your schedule, take an unrelated class - I took one or two literature focused classes while I was a Computer Science major.  Most of my college friends came from those extra classes.

 If you live in a dorm with a meal plan, don't go ham on the buffet.  Try to keep yourself to one plate of food without going back for seconds.  If you can opt out of a meal plan, do it.  You'll never get what you pay for without getting fat!

 Do your homework and study outside of your dorm room.  If you have nearby study lounges, try to do your homework there.  If you need to walk a little ways to a library, do it, and do your homework there.  Make your dorm room a place of comfort, not associated with schoolwork, if possible.

 Enjoy it and best of luck!

The line "follow your dreams and the money will come" is a total and complete lie. You need to follow the money and do what you love as a hobby.Don't forget chip clips and an umbrella!Don't spend all of your time with your boyfriend/girlfriend. Make other friends.Take an internship for credit. I didn't because I always had a job since I was 16 and didn't see the point in working for "free." Guess who's still working in restaurants.Don't stay in your dorm room all the time. Being social with even the people in the dorm can go a a long way to making college life easier to adapt to and fix your schedule around so it doesn't burn you out.Step as far out of your comfort zone as you possibly can. Take your math class first. Every major is going to require at least Math 105 or some shit. Don't wait until your senior year because "oh I hate math." You will forget everything you ever knew about algebra and possibly not graduate on time. I saw soooo many of my friends do this. Just bite the bullet and take it your freshman year. 


Also, go to class. I didn't and I regret it. ***Learn to prioritize sleep.*** 

Many, if not most, college students are walking around in a state of some level of sleep deprivation -- having trouble concentrating, craving junk food all the time, feeling moody or depressed, creating drama, and having issues controlling their impulses. All without the awareness that all this would be greatly helped by just getting enough sleep. (This is not to mention just plain nodding off in class,which feels awful and defeats the whole purpose of showing up in the first place, not to mention doesn't do much to ingratiate you with your prof.)

It's different for everybody, but a I think a good starting prescription is to get 7.5 hours four nights and week and 9 the other three. 

As a professor myself, it may seem like we are assigning a ridiculous, undoable amount of work, but we aren't. We've been at this a long time and we know what the lower-end of average student can take and that is what we aim at. We also take into account that you need to have have some sort of life outside of work and accommodate for other classes. Once you start cheating on your sleep too much, the wheels come off. Assignments take longer and longer to do, procrastination seems more and more appealing, unhelpful stimulants enter into the fix in far larger quantities than can be helpful. And that is how the workload seems unmanageable.

TL;DR - Go the fuck to sleep.
If you see someone on campus that looks homeless, this is a grad student.  If they are out in evening they are hunting for sources of free food, follow them and get pizza at some group event.Work your ass off Monday through Thursday. Party hard Friday and Saturday. Recuperate Sunday.Get to know everyone in your major. You're going to be spending the next four years with them so you might as well be friendsThis may be your one and only chance to work towards becoming a successful adult, so don't screw off and shirk your studies, and take your forthcoming college education seriously.Don't skip lectures too often. It's ok once or twice but too many times and you'll regret it. Lectures are important!Treat school like it's your job. Stay focused on the work and produce professional-grade results.Bed skirts are unnecessary.Stay aware of who you surround yourself with.  Pursue friendship with people you respect and enjoy. Watch out for vampires.Learn what study method works best for you.  Everyone learns differently, don't be afraid to try something new. Get your ass to class.Talk to people! There is such a huge pool of people who are also willing to meet others.If you have any paperwork that has to be done offline, walk it from department to department, don't trust them to get it done on time Join a club. It's a great way to meet people and to give yourself something fun to do. There's tons of clubs on most campuses. Find one that you're interested and get involved.* Failing a class isn't the end of the world. It will feel like it the first time, it will make you think you can't get though college and that you don't belong there, but you just need to buckle down and try again. No need to throw away your future because you were irresponsible for a semester.

* Nobody cares about what you are doing, wearing, watching, playing, etc. It's not high school, do whatever you enjoy and you will find others who enjoy that too. Nobody is going to look down on you because you have a weird hobby.

* DON'T use your classmates as a good estimate of what you should be getting done in the first year! A lot of your class is going to drop out, if you use them as a estimate for what you should be getting done by when you are going to fail the class with them.

* Find the balance you need between play and work. Too much play and you are going to fail out. Too much work and you're going to stress yourself out and fail anyways. It's a balancing act that might take you a year to get down. Freshman year is a learning experience, If you notice yourself constantly stressed out to the point of distress or are failing your exams you need to change things up and quick. Nobody is going to stop and wait for you.

I'm probably not the best person to get advice from here, but if you got any questions or worries don't be afraid to message me!
You can't expect to use the same study methods you used to coast through high school, and succeed in college. You actually have to put time and effort into writing papers and studying for exams. I learned this the hard way my first year.Get out of our comfort zone.  Force yourself if you have to.

Just do your damn work. In my last year of college and have gotten on the dean's list every semester. Do your work when assigned and don't procrastinate and you'll have plenty of free time. And don't go on social media complaining about assignments, finals, etc.Graduating Senior here. I've boiled it down to 6 things I tell incoming freshmen. 

1. Never turn down a free meal

2. The first few weeks you'll either poop too much or not nearly enough. That's normal. 

3. Bring your own toilet paper, if the school supplies it, it's usually nothing you want to put near your asshole. 

4. Wait a month before skipping a class, usually by that time you'll have a feel if you can get away with it or not. 

5. Go to office hours and introduce yourself the first week. Getting on your professor's good side is always good

6. Don't lose your syllabus Don't take 8am classes. I never took a class before noon. Also avoid Friday classes.

Go. To. Class. You get ONE skip per class.

Fuck greek life. Don't even bother with it.

Just do your schoolwork. You'll have plenty of time to party. Unless you're an engineering major. 

If you're doing drugs, be smart about it. 

The clubs at college aren't all as lame as the ones in highschool. 

Avoid all involvement with the student government. Its a circle jerk, and its petty. The biggest assholes on campus are the executive board. Assume your advisor is wrong because they probably are. Double check what courses you need to take in order to graduate on time.Pledge or at least rush a fraternity if you're a dude. It can drastically change your social scene for the better. 
And even if you only rush, you can meet a ton of new potential friends at parties. 
You don't have to worry about your major yet. If you do want to declare right away, I highly recommend going for the most broad possible major for the subject you're interested in (i.e. Business/Economics major for anything in Economics, Physics/Engineering for something in the Sciences) so that you have to take a bunch of classes in a lot of different majors to help you narrow your options.

I started with Physics, and while I decided to stick with it, the nature of the degree meant that I also have had to take Engineering, Chemistry, Biology, and a bunch of Math classes just in the pursuit of that degree. And if I had at any point decided I wanted to switch to something else within that field I would have had at least a couple of classes already crossed off as well as a basic but sufficient basis in the subject to get me started in more advanced classes right off the bat.You can't have it all. Set yourself some goals and be aware of the sacrifices they require!

I wanted to have outstanding grades, be the most social person in the world and meet bunch of new friends, exercise and do sport every day, enjoy the city, be the best partner ever for my SO, have lots of time for my hobbies, do lots of internships and so on... The truth is, if you want to do something good, it takes time, so you better spend some time thinking about your priorities :)
The professor is not your teacher or personal tutor.  They are your *guide* to the information available to you and the mediator when discussing that material.  It is up to you to figure out how to transfer that material in to your head.  It is also up to you to understand what that material *means.*  Now, granted, any respectable professor will discuss what the material means with you, and that *might* change your perceptions on the meaning of that material.  This is usually a good thing.  

If it is the case that this kind of independent learning and studying is too difficult or you lack the motivation to do so, then college and/or university might not be for you.  College is half what you learn from classes and half what you learn about yourself as a person as you leave everything you know. Join clubs...even if it seems stupid from the beginning. In most cases there will be a club that you will like. 
Also if there is an activities board that plans campus activities and such if they have general meeting for anyone to attend try going to a few because then you will learn what happens on campus and you can meet a lot of new people there too.

If you're considering Greek life then go and rush, but just sit back and think about everything first. These people are basically trying to sell you that their organization is the best so rush week isn't always a good way to see the truest form of how these people act. 

Not only meet the professors, but also try and meet the university staff also! You get to see how the school runs and it gives you a better idea of how the big picture works.Condoms. Condoms. Condoms.Wear a condom.  If college isn't working out, drop out and come back later when you have shit figured out. No one gives a shit if you graduate in 4 years or 8 years. School isn't for everyone and you can get by without it. ***DON'T SKIP CLASS***Give sleep priority over everything. Make the next priority meals.Don't get so hung up on a girl you lose sight of what's around you and go to office hours...
*sigh* As a professor: you are paying for this.  Go to class.  No, I will not re-teach my class because you were hungover/watching Golden Girls/in line at the Chik-Fil-A/at Disneyworld.Be original, don't buy a North Face coat...(even though they're so damn comfortable and built like steel).make sure your mental health is squared away. i wouldn't be surprised if a large plurality of flunk outs are due to depression, anxiety, and panic disorders popping up 'suddenly' in kids who are just living on their own for the first time. 

if you feel extremely unmotivated, oddly fearful of everything or everyone, or are just feeling like something just isn't right, you need to see a professional. luckily, most universities have someone on staff who can see you and talk about your issues. don't delay: talk to them.I think a lot of the stuff on here about education/party life is pretty on point. My advice would be to find a few (like 2 or 3 at the most) student organizations that you really feel calls out to you. Join it and really spend a lot of time with it. From what I've seen, clubs are an amazing source of great friends and experiences if you give it 100%, but next to useless if you don't. It doesn't even have to be about something related to your major e.g. poker club, pick up a new sport or instrument, etc. Yes this means that you will have to juggle both schoolwork and this club, but if it's for something you truly feel passionate about, it won't feel as bad.Don't sell drugs, especially out of a dorm room.  

It starts innocently.  You're just trying to get some for free.  It escalates because demand far exceeds supply.  It continues because it's lucrative.  It ends because you will be either arrested or robbed.  Don't procrastinate Dress well, talk to girls, and major in something that'll get you a good paying job.1. Pay attention during the lectures and read any material on time, this has saved me from having to ever cram any material and spit it back up the next morning, and has allowed me to walk in to tests for astronomy and physics and get 105 (extra credit questions) In 15 minutes or less.
2. Don't apologize for being late, just sit down.
3. Don't buy the university sweatshirt day 1.You're gonna have a bad time for at least the first month. After that, it depends on the decisions you'll make.Although it may feel like it, student loans are NOT free money. 

Careful how you spend it. You dont want to be another statistic and be in debt 200k after you get your philosophy degree and unable to find a decent job.Best advice I got- "This is your job for the next four years. Treat it like a job. Show up and do the work."Don't be a dick to your RA. They can be the difference between a night of fun and having your night ruined. If you have a professor that you like, take the time to go to his/her office hours. Forging relationships with professors will prove invaluable later on when you are looking for research opportunities or applying for graduate school (most require 3-4 letters of recommendation).Sex sex sex sex sexIf youre drunk dont driveIf you're going out always have at least 1 or 2 other people with you or let your roommate or another friend know where you are going.Ask for help in your classes if you need it. It's expected that you may have classes that are harder than you're used to, or you might struggle with. Going to office hours, asking a T.A. for help, etc. early on if you are having an issue can help you get back on track quickly and do well. Coming to your professor at the end of the quarter and trying to find a way to get an "A" when you haven't done well on a lot of assignments is unlikely to go well.Cum on her face. College chicks DGAF.Use condoms.Always wear a condom.Join a club, especially if its in your field of study. I just finished a Bachelor's program for Architectural Engineering, and two clubs AIAS (American Institute of Architect Students) and ASHRAE (American Society Heating Refrigeration Air conditioning Engineers) I didn't join till my last year. Both were a blast, had two awesome trips. I didn't think I could have time to join these clubs, 20 minutes a week is nothing. You really don't do much but the people are worth it.When your professors give you their syllabi, put major due dates/test dates in your calendar. It takes just a few minutes and it easily helps you know in advance which weeks you have like 12 tests and 10 papers dueYou're there to learn and set yourself up for the rest of your life. Working your ass off for four years can set you up for major success. College (at least in the US) is way to expensive to drop out or have to stay longer from failing classes because you were partying. 

Not trying to be a party pooper or say that you can't have any fun in college, but I had way too many friends who dropped out or had to stay extra and are now in even more crippling debt, which, especially if you didn't finish that degree so you have limited job options can seriously fuck up your life. Take care of your health. 

-Make a schedule of EVERYTHING. Not just classes; also how long it would take to walk to and from each class, how long each homework session should be, how long meals should last, everything. 

-As everybody's already said, go to class, even if you know the class is very boring. Any lecture/discussion/whatever you don't go to is tuition you're wasting. 

-Join a club. Doesn't have to be a fraternity/sorority; you just need to make friends. Having somebody to talk to in every class about projects/homework/the material is more helpful than you know. 

-Some professors suck at teaching. Which is why you should seek help by going to office hours or watching Youtube videos or studying with friends. Some professors don't see it as their responsibility to teach, but it is your responsibility to learn.
Do'nt slack of in your electives, econ 101 is easy but at least show up to the lectures, do all the quizzes and read the textbook for fucks sake * Double Majors don't really mean anything, but *Double Degrees* do.  It's OK to pursue a double major if that's what you really want to do, but just remember that you might not study any one major in a deep enough way, and you may have two sets of final exams to do.  Minors, in my experience, are also pretty useless.

* Always go to class UNLESS you are going to be distracted the whole time, e.g. sick, nodding off, constantly looking at your phone.  This is especially true if you are in a smaller class.  If you are "distracted," chances are you're also being *distracting* and the professor would rather you not be there if you are not engaged.

* Take advantage of your professor's office hours, especially if you're gong to be writing papers for that class.  Being able to have in-depth cerebral discussions with your instructors is something you'll appreciate when you can't do it anymore.

* If you have a foreign-language requirement to graduate, get that out of the way ASAP.

Finally, try to quickly develop a concrete idea of what your desired professional outcome is for your experience and work towards that goal; wandering around aimlessly searching for purpose, career-wise, is a terrible place to be.

That being said, a lot of students in the USA these days approach the college experience with a transactional attitude, and get drawn to fields where they *could* draw six-figure salaries, which is fine, but just remember there are a lot of people who hate their lives and careers because *that's precisely what they did*. 

People talk about one-time English majors who end up working at Barnes & Noble, but I've also seen one-time CS majors who ended up as Comcast installation techs and one-time pre-law students who ended up as tow-truck drivers.  Point is, whether or not you follow the money you can still end up somewhere you didn't want to go.  If you look at college from a career-development standpoint, it's only one step on that journey.You're going to find that hanging out with friends almost always involves food. Either don't feel obligated to eat if you're not hungry or start a solid workout regimen.

Start a solid workout regimen anyway.I hope you got your partying out of the way in high school. Do NOT major in journalism Learn how to study: http://www.zencollegelife.com/the-50-best-study-aid-blogs/Everyone has their own experiences, so take the advice of other people with a grain of salt. But still, some good advice: try to get along with your roommate, but don't think you have to become BFFs with them. If you're struggling with school for whatever reason, talk to a counselor - academic or emotional. Don't be afraid to transfer to another school if you're not really liking this one. And definitely don't be afraid or ashamed to drop out. College isn't for everyone, and you might find you're just not ready for college at this point in time, or should consider going to school later.

And some people will tell you "don't take 8 am classes!" Just think about how you functioned throughout the day in high school and work your schedule around that. For instance, I always get really sleepy at 2 pm, so I always opted to take as few afternoon classes as possible. Don't worry too much about getting you're life figured out, especially as underclassmen. Enjoy the newfound freedom, don't go crazy (but do try those things you couldn't under your parents' tutelage), and take time to pursue & develop new interests/skills. Man, I feel so strongly about this question: doggedly pursue an internship oppertunity with a professor, immediately. Before you even start. 

Don't wait until your second semester to feel things out, it doesn't even matter if you haven't settled on your major, pick a major (any major) immediately, research faculty in that department, and send an email out to everyone who interests you asking for an interview to work for them. This is when you're most valuable, when you have the potential to give 7.5 semesters of legitimate productivity (minus a semester training). 

You should think of good grades and a degree the same way as you think of a GED, you just need to have that to get a crappy  intro job (or even internship) after you graduate.

What will set you apart in the job/grad school market is the experience, senior thesis, and most importantly that letter of recommendation. 

It's the easiest thing in the world to completely change majors and direction at any time - as long as you have the record of working productively outside class in that first field you picked. 

But if you let that full freshman year slip away 'getting adjusted', you're going to be a much tougher sale as an incoming sophomore who didn't do anything their first year. Fuck everyone.

Seriously, I was feeling so lonely fall semester. Joined up with a club at the end of fall, and there wasn't a dull moment spring semester. I had so many new people to talk to and hang out with. And I went to school in the same city I graduated high school in.

If you have a disability or anything that could be considered as such, get registered. Professors are people, and will most likely be happy to help you out. 

Going on the last, professors are people too. They're remarkably human, and you'll have a different dynamic with them than you had with your high school teachers. A lot of my professors let us email them for anything, even to just talk about college in general. 

Don't go for the easy A every time. Chances are, it won't be interesting. 

You don't have to be friends with your roommate. But you two have to respect each other. Don't budge on your boundaries. 

Go to all of the lame freshman stuff. You'll make friends, that's exactly what they're for. 

Everybody is looking to make new friends. It's beyond acceptable to introduce yourself to a stranger. It'll happen quite frequently. 

Watch your drinking. 

Go to class. Professors notice, and sometimes you'll miss out on something big. It's really not worth it and sets bad habits if you start skipping class. 

Have fun, seriously. The first week or two are going to be a blast. Then you have to get to work. Enjoy the hell out of those two weeks.Be respectful to teachers. Not a kiss ass. They might cut you some slack in the kong run. Also make it to class. I cant stress that enough because if you dont. They dont care not at all. They will treat you accordingly too. Also make some friends and keep some time for yourself. Not too much but there is such thing as overworking and you will be miserable if you do so. Thats about it man finished my freshman year about a week ago. If you don't like college, it might be the college itself.  If that's the case, transfer.  I wish I would have.In regards to academics, make sure to be on top of everything every single day. Even if you don't have class, make sure to check the website (we used d2l/blackboard) to look at your assignments. There were a few times freshman year where I missed a quiz or two for an easy class but lost those points because I just straight up forgot they were due. Thankfully it only happened once or twice but I've known friends who miss a lot of them and they add up.

For the easy gen-ed classes you are probably going to take freshman year, it is important to just do the work given. Most of the assignments are easy and are just busy work. Never forget to finish these assignments because they will add up and could hurt your grade.

This is probably the biggest advice I could give to freshmen specifically. High School was a cake walk in the sense that there would be (besides math) one or two assignments due per week. In college, every day there could be something due whether it be a reading quiz or a homework quiz. For the love of God do not go on with your day thinking you have nothing to do! If you have a day off get ahead in one assignment or something. In college usually how it goes is there will be a couple of weeks of "downtime" and then you have 3 tests and 2 quizzes the next week.

I can't stress how important it is to check for homework every day. I used to wake up and check first thing in the morning what we had to do for the day and I'd make a checklist. I know I could have made this piece of advice more succinct but it is so important I decided to stretch it out just so you get the idea of how important it is to check everything.* Learn to like beer.

* Meet as many people as possible, everyone has a different story and you never know where a conversation can get you.

* Exercise! Going for a run helps clear your mind and those endorphins help boost your mood.

* Call home every once and awhile. Update your parents with everything that's going on, they'll be happy to hear from you.

* If social greek life isn't for you, check out service and professional fraternities. There's a lot of different options with greek organizations and not all fraternities are the same.

* Get out of your comfort zone. Do things you haven't done before, it's college after all.

Study, do your homework, but don't forget to have fun every once in awhile.Don't just go to class, be on time and have at least a notebook and a pen(cil). Sitting in front also helps, since teachers see all of it and are more inclined to be lenient when you need it. Also go to office hours at least once or be early to ask questions before class or just chat. 80% of professors are actually pretty cool people.Don't pretend to be the kind of college kid you see on T.V. - I don't know why people think they have to act like someone on T.V. as soon as they get to college. Also, don't just try to label yourself. Nobody should be able to just figure you out just by looking at you or talking to you for 4 seconds. 

Some people don't know how to be social, so they start drama. Avoid those people. These are the people that are like "Man, you met that Tony kid? I don't like him." - Tony might be an asshole, but if you stick around the guy that wants to start shit with everyone, you will get involved. Not just guys, but females too. If you don't intend to study, it will save you time to just send around $30,000 through a paper shredder.Don't cram. Don't wait until the last minute. Keep up with your reading and homework. You do this and college is a piece of cake. Don't feel the need to remain besties with the same crowd all throughout college. Sometimes people move on, and that's cool. You don't need a collage of twelve photos from freshman to senior year with the same five people to prove that you had the best ever experience. Branch out. If your friend makes fun of you for joining a club or doing study abroad in a "not cool" place, fuck em. Do you.  

Also, on a completely different and very contradictory note: don't be lanyard guy, or armpit purse + backpack girl.Please don't try to completely reinvent yourself: I'm talking a whole new look, new catchphrases, everything. Just be you and change a little bit at a time. You'll be a completely new person by 21 anyway; save yourself some lolworthy embarrassment.Don't take advice from RedditorsDelete facebook and hit the gym. It gets harder to gain as you get older.Bring an umbrella and shoes that can stand up against water if your campus floods. 

CS majors, at least start your projects within three days of assignment. 

You will have to study. There's no way around it. Even if you didn't in high school. 

Invest in a fake if there are bars close to campus. 

Find the gym and know the hours to go that best fit your schedule. The freshman 15 is extremely real (I went from 180 to 200). 

If you're on a big campus, learn the bus routes. Also there are probably faster ways to walk to class than what you're currently doing. Experiment with different paths. 

Explore around campus if you can. Also know cool off campus spots like parks, restaurants etc. 

Study. 

Try to schedule classes that don't srart until ~10am. This will ease the urge to sleep in and skip. And please, don't skip. The subject material is markedly more difficult and some professors will only post parts of slides, often no examples etc. 

Make time for you! Whether it's exercising, playing video games, hanging with friends or just taking a nap, you need you time. 

Nobody gets acclimated to college right away in freshman year. It is perfectly normal to feel homesick, isolated, depressed etc and it may take months or even several semesters/quarters to get used to it. Your university is making money by lying to you. Don't believe all the administration's bullshit about how great everyone there is doing. The kids who make it in the school newspaper time after time are the top 10% of students. C's get degrees. Whatever happens, just keep trucking.

Unless you're in danger of failing an entire semester in which case it's better to take a bunch of incompletes (for "personal reasons") than to end up on academic probation. It's a scummy way to fuck over everyone who actually has to drop out for personal reasons, not just grades, but you should still know.Don't have a tunnel vision, only taking classes directly relevant to your major: use your required elective credits to take interesting classes which have nothing to do with it. You may find a new hobby or even a new career aspiration. Make the most of your time. 

Also, it is okay to change your major. In my case, I changed from Neuroscience to Film and couldn't be happier.Misery always creeped me the fuck out. For the sole reason that people like that exist.The Descent. John Carpenters The Thing Alien (1979)For me it's The Strangers. 
But being stalked and pretty much tortured in my own house and seeing someone standing at the window in the dark is my biggest fear so that could be why Event HorizonI've seen most popular horror movies that have come out in the last ten or so years, and the one that fucked me up the most was *[REC]*. The English remake *Quarantine* does it no justice. I slept with the lights on for the next few days.

Also *The Ring* and *Sinister* are notable mentions. Probably more that I can't think of.The Hills have eyes - cuz that shit could happenIn recent memory? The Conjuring. Slept with the lights on for a few weeks after that.

Overall? The Exorcist. Saw it once - that was enough for me.Poltergeist (1982)The Vanishing (1988)

WARNING: Do not watch this movie if you are claustrophobic. The Mothman Prophecies.  The Shining has to be up there. Seeing that as a kid really fucked up my nights for a long time lolThe 1974 version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. 28 Days Later - those fast vicious infected scared me. I was very disturbed by the Conjuring. It is the meanness and sheer amount of hate that demon is filled with. It was like a thing by itself. The Texas Chainsaw Masscre and its 2003 remake For me it was Steven King's "IT"   but I think most of that was because I was so young when I watched it. :/  a lot of things are more scary when you're young. Not the scariest, but "It Follows" is pretty damn creepy.The Exorcist - It's a classic in the horror genre..I watched Silent Hill when I was about 13 and man, that scared the living bejesus out of me. But then I watched it three more times after to actually understand the goddamn confusing plot. The combination of *The Ring* and *The Grudge* (American versions) made me stop watching horror movies entirely.  Noped the fuck out. The Ring"They" was pretty scary. Especially the end.I literally went home and bought a glock after watching "The Strangers"...

It shot my "I know how to survive a horror movie" plan all to shit (don't act like you don't have one too)... You know when you're watching a scary movie and you think to yourself "meh, I could live through this, if that shit happened to me I'd just X"... Yeah, so when the girl is standing in the kitchen and gets creeped out I literally said out loud "come on bitch, at least grab a knife!" ...and then she did...  

Shortly after when the boyfriend gets back I looked at my girlfriend who was sitting with me in the theater and said "this shit would never happen to us, I have a gun."... No sooner than the words came out of my mouth the boyfriend in the movie goes and gets his shotgun.
Grave Encounters and 1408 are two of my favorites.

I think they can both be considered "haunted house movies", and even though they do have bits with actual spooky things being shown, most of the scary parts come from a constant feeling of dread, that something is not quite right. I remember both of them having a very specific moment that made me go "Oh.. Fuck.." and made my stomach drop, leaving me feeling as helpless as the characters in the movie.

Also if you're familiar with "Ghost Adventures" (a paranormal TV show) then Grave Encounters will get a few giggles out of you since they poke fun at that particular show especially in the very beginning. The movie is far from being a comedy though.

BONUS ENTRY: The House of the Devil because I like it and because of how perfectly a 2009 movie recreated the look and feel of a movie from the 80's.Well according to almost every list of scariest movie ever put on the internet: The Exorcist.

I strongly agree.In my opinion, *The Blair Witch Project* because although you never see anything actually "happen", it's still mentally alarming to watch the characters get more and more desperate, and neither them nor the viewer knows what's really going on.The Grudge.  It was the only movie that really bothered me.  Between her eye, and that damn kid meowing[deleted]Misery has to be up there.  It fucks with your head.My favorite movie is still "Shutter" the Thai version. I actually like most Asian horrors even if they tend to use the same tropes.. they use them because they're creepy. My favorite horror movies are the ones that haunt me. You know when you finish a movie and you just feel so deeply disturbed? That's what I get from a majority of Asian horrors. I don't care for jump scares, I'm in it for the morbidness you can't shake off even years after the movie's ended.The taking of Deborah Logan. Dude. Strangers-stalkers in the woods.  Random reasons.  Awesome horror."Tucker and Dale vs Evil" because that could happen to anyone.  You're out in the woods minding your own business, and kids start fucking with you in some weird suicide pact or something.  
I know plenty of people don't agree, but I honestly think the paranormal activity movies are really well done. Silence of the Lambs. Specifically, the scene where crazy-lotion-guy is stalking Clarisse with the night-vision goggles.I like ones like The Strangers or I Saw the Devil (Also my favorite movie in any category).I've watched plenty of scary movies, but for some reason,  "It follows," was a recent one that made me slightly paranoid in real life after watching.I saw some other thread simillar they said one of the scariest was 'it follows' can someone confirm this?The ConjuringTie between 13 ghosts, which always gives me nightmares, or Stephen King's It, which I've only seen once. Recently, I haven't seen any movie that terrified me.The Birds or JawsEven though I did not particularly care for the movie itself, The Grudge is by far the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life. My friends and I were unironically hugging each other out of fear. I'm not sure what it was that made it so scary either. I'm totally one of those wimps who will cover their eyes when something scary is happening during a movie, so perhaps The Grudge really got to me because of the creepy sounds? Either way, 10/10 scare, will never watch again.I think Candyman was scary.Ju-On / The GrudgeParanormal Activity but only the first one.IdiocracyThe BabadookDefinitely The Exorcist. It is so very well acted and believable that it can make you feel as though you, or someone you know, could become a victim of an angry demon. I remember watching this very young and freaking me the fuck out. And although the fear factor has let up over the years, there is something about that movie that still puts terror in my heart. The ExorcistThe changeling(1980) is an effectively creepy movie[Phantoms](https://youtu.be/HynK3ZkjtcE)

I'm not a big gore fan, it's kind of a cheap shot, and not showing something is usually a lot scarier than showing to much. 

Back in high school some friends wanted to rent a scary movie, thinking about one of the slasher movies like usual. I talked them into watching this one instead, and afterward the general consensus was that it was a lot creepier/scarier than what they were expecting.Sings was pretty scary. I know a lot if people don't like it period. But for a sci-fi it scarred me. The Cold Prey (Norwegian: Fritt Vilt) series was very good. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and Cold Prey was impressively scary. An American Werewolf in London, that scene after they leave the village in the beginning freaks me the fuck out.The Sixth Sense for me, hands down.Saw it the week it came out when I was in my 30s and to this day the scene where the the kid says to Cole " I'll show you where my dad's gone is" sends shivers down my spine."Eyes Wide Shut". It's not considered a horror movie by most people but I consider every frame of it to be absolute nightmare fuel. Then it gets hide-in-a-closet-forever terrifying when you realize what the film is telling you. ITTo this day the 1988 version of the blob is the only horror movie that leaves me feeling unsettled.Exorcist and Signs
The ShiningCannibal Holocaust...not a straight up horror movie but very unsettling.'One Missed Call' the 2003 Japanese version. Goddamn that's so scary.The Blair Witch Project1408 for its sheer mind screw

Evil dead was just horrific for me, both version but the remake was absolutely foul last time I watched it with the mother of all hangovers after a tequila binge. Would recommend by way of making you realise the world hasn't ended and you aren't in fact as dead as you feel though that smell is most likely yourself.Not sure if this counts entirely as a horror movie, but The Invitation really freaked me out. I'll go with Ringu. Never ever expected Sadako to crawl out of the damn tvThe Decent got me good..so did The Fourth Kind. The Tunnel. Maybe it's scary to me because i'm actually FROM Sydney, but even outside of that, it's just a really effective, well-written, well-acted found footage movie with remarkably good camera work. If you haven't seen it, definitely give it a go. I still rewatch it from time to time because I find it so well done.I really enjoyed Sinister. The right blend of ghost kids,  disturbing imagery, jump scares and atmospheric music. Plus, I like the end a lot. Too bad the sequel was fucking retarded. 

However, it's a subjective thing. 
Poltergeist.  Tried watching it once, shut it off and have never tried again.  And I usually don't get scared at movies.Bone Tomohawk. "Taint hatcheting" so aweful[A Serbian Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddwrbcMmzlc) made me feel ill.  Kind of a different choice, but *Zodiac* is it for me. Really got to me in a different, more meaningful way than any other movie I've ever seen.I loved the Evil Dead remakeThe scariest ever would be my high school! But, no really, the last time I saw a horror movie I cried.(12 years old, amityville horror)I really liked both parts of Insidious. Like many other horror movies, you need to allow them to scare you - watch attentively, preferably in darkness, etc. But when you do, it's really good. 

Edit: and now I've found out there's a third. I should watch that.The BabadookFirst, go to /r/horror. 2nd, what subgenre of horror? Realistic, like The Strangers? Paranormal, like Paranormal Activity? Slasher, like A Nightmare on Elm Street? Torture Porn, like Inside? Comedy, like Tucker & Dale versus Evil? Found footage, like REC?

The Thing ~ The Exorcist ~ The Ring ~ Paranormal Activity (the last 20 minutes) ~ Mulholland Drive ~ The Orphanage ~ Martyrs ~ Jesus Camp Grown Ups 2, Jack and Jill, and Pixels.

There so bad, it's **SCARY**[deleted]There are mathematical ideas that we believe, but have not yet been able to prove or disprove.

One is the Collatz Conjecture: starting with any positive integer, do the following: if it's an even number, divide it in half. If it's an odd number, multiply it by three and add one to the result. The conjecture: you always end up at the number one. For example . . .

3 is odd, so we'll multiply it by 3 and add 1 to the result:

3 -> 10

Now 10 is even, so we cut it in half and get 5. But 5 is odd, so we continue:

5 -> 16

16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1! We got it!

Let's try a different number -- start with 11:

11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 (big beath) -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1! Wow!

Computers have shown that all the numbers up to 10^65 obey the conjecture. And mathematicians have shown that if there is a counterexample, it must be very, very big, and have many, many steps before a repetition/pattern occurs in the attempt of its computation.How big 52! really is:

* Set a timer to count down 52! seconds (that's 8.0658x10^67 seconds)
* Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years
* When you've circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and keep going
* When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.
* When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer

The 3 left-most digits won't have changed. 8.063x10^67 seconds left to go. You have to repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time. 5.385x10^67 seconds left to go.

So to kill that time you try something else.

* Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 cards every billion years
* Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket
* Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon
* When the grand canyon's full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest, empty the canyon and carry on.
* When Everest has been levelled, check the timer

There's barely any change. 5.364x10^67 seconds left. You'd have to repeat this process 256 times to have run out the timer.

Edit: Changed four instances of 1067 to 10^67 thanks to /u/The_AlpacapocalypseA lot of our mathematical symbols come from one dude, Leonhard Euler:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_EulerThere are different sizes of infinity.We have that

* the integral from 0 to infinity of sin(x) / x dx = pi/2
* the integral from 0 to infinity of (sin(x) / x)\*3(sin(x/3) / x) dx = pi/2

* the integral from 0 to infinity of (sin(x) / x)\*3(sin(x/3) / x)\*5(sin(x/5) / x) dx = pi/2

And so on all the way up to 13. But once we multiply up to the factor containing 15 it is equal to pi/2 - 6879714958723010531/935615849440640907310521750000 pi.

This is the [Borwein integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein_integral)It takes just 23 people for the odds being more than 50% that 2 of them have the same birthday. And only 70 people for there to be a 99.9% probability. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problemIf you have a set with just 33 elements, you can assign a distinct subset to each person in the world and still have over a billion subsets left over.Newton developed the entirety of calculus in about the time it takes the average student to learn it..9999999... = 1.Anything looks surprising when it's a factorial!There is just as many even numbers as even and odd numbers put together.R^n has a unique smooth structure for all n except for 4, which has *infinitely many*.

Sharkovskii's theorem gives a surprising result: If a continuous interval map has a cycle of period 3, then it has cycles of *all* periods. (The theorem is more precise than this, but it would be a pain to explain).   

For the uninitiated, applications of the pigeonhole principle can be surprising. Such as: If you have a sphere with 5 points on it, then there's always a closed hemisphere which contains 4 of them. 

If you have 10 people sitting on 10 chairs, there are 3,628,800  possible permutations of rearranging the people. 

This is mathematically expressed by 10!
 It blew my mind when I first came upon it; it seemed like too many combinations but its true. 

Side note: 10!= 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8x9x10 

Edit: Permutations not combinations.  This has been asked [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/45m1zl/whats_the_coolest_mathematical_fact_you_know_of/) as well.Here are some of the best of facts

* The decimal fractions of seven are the same six recurring digits, in the same order, but starting from a different one each time.
1/7 = 0.142857142857...
2/7 = 0.285714285714...
3/7 = 0.428571428571...
4/7 = 0.571428571428...

* 10! seconds = 6 weeks

* The guy that proved the existence of irrational numbers was [murdered] (http://nrich.maths.org/2671) for his finding.
* x% of y = y% of x

 y(x/100) = x(y/100)

 yx/100 = xy/100

 So, in order to calculate a percentage in your head it might be easier to turn it around.
 Example
 What is 2% of 50? It's the same thing as 50% of 2.

* The Fibonacci sequence is encoded in the number 1/89:
1/89 = 0.01 + 0.001 + 0.0002 + 0.00003 + 0.000005 + 0.0000008 + 0.00000013 + 0.000000021 + 0.0000000034...

* There is an entire book explaining how 1+1=2 works and makes sense

* The BanachTarski paradox: Given a solid ball, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball.

* 22/7 is closer to the actual value of pi than 3.14 is.
* 1000000000000066600000000000001
 This is the most metal number.
 This number has unlucky 13 zeroes, followed by the number of the beast, 666, then another unlucky 13 zeroes.
 It's a palindrome, read the same backwards and forwards.
 It's a PRIME NUMBER.
 It's called Belphegor's Prime, named after a demonProbably a lame one, but 111,111,111^2 = 12,345,678,987,654,321Even though you can do multiples of 11 up to 5 digits quickly, it's simple with any digit number.  Add the two outer numbers and stick it between. IE:

11 x 36

3 + 6 = 9

So = 396

If the two numbers are greater than 10 just add 1 to the first digit. 

11 x 56

5+6=11 so 616That you can have an infinite surface area and at the same time a finite volume. Think of a cake, slice it in two, now each half in two, and continue, you will have the infinite surface area, but the volume will be the cake you started with. Evariste Galois, a French mathematician during the revolution created a new algebraic language especially useful to describe symetries. He wrote all of it on super dirty papers and as a student sent everything to academics including Cauchy but they couldnt understand anything because of how big of a mess his work was.

At the age of 20 he had a duel with another man, got injured really bad and taken to the hospital, he spent the whole night re-writing his work cleanly and understandably and died the next day. 

He was only a 20 years old student and developed a quite impressive theory. Too bad he died a such a ridiculous wayDo you know the look-and-say sequence? It goes:

* 1 (one)
* 11 (one one)
* 21 (two ones)
* 1211 (one two one one)
* etc

After each step, the length of the sequence grows approximately by 30%. The exact number is the unique positive real root of a polynomial of degree ~~72~~ 71. How crazy!

When you move to four consecutive positive integers, their product will be divisible by 24. 

This is because I'm any 3 consecutive numbers, there will be a number divisible by two and a number divisible by three. So in the prime factorization of their product you are guaranteed to have a 2x3, or a 6.

When you move up to 4, you are now guaranteed to have numbers divisible by 2,3 and 4. So there will always be 2x3x4 is the factorization, or a 24.

Ex: 3x4x5 = 60 = 6x10

That sum is trivially divergent, it goes to infinitely.

When you apply the Ramanujan summation to this series that is the result, but it is not the true sum.

>Ramanujan summation is a technique invented by the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan for assigning a value to infinite divergent series. Although the Ramanujan summation of a divergent series is not a sum in the traditional sense, it has properties which make it mathematically useful in the study of divergent infinite series, for which conventional summation is undefined.Not really surprising but some people don't seem to understand it.

If I flip a non rigged coin 100 times and the first 99 times it comes up heads, tails is not "due". The next flip is still 50/50The n-th root of 2 is irrational, this in and of itself isn't surprising. You might find this proof for n>2 surprising however:

Assume a rational solution exists for some n>2,

(x/y) =  2^(1/n)    (statement)

(x^n ) / (y^n ) = 2    (sub)

(x^n ) = 2 * (y^n )  (multiply both sides by y^n )

x^n = y^n + y^n  (expand) 


Contradiction: No integers x,y exist where x^n = y^n + y^n for n>2 per Fermat's last theorem (Wiles '95).

QED.The ratio of two consecutive terms in the Fibonacci sequence approaches phi, the Golden Ratio, as the terms get larger. This is somewhat common knowledge.

In fact, it's not a property of the Fibonacci sequence, but rather a property of *any* sequence where you add the two previous terms to get the next term.If it's discovered that the universe is predetermined from the start with no randomness, this would mean that everything until this point is just mathematical processes interacting with each other. 

This is interesting as it would mean that everything we know (including all decisions you and others make every second), theoretically could be written out by an immortal with pen and paper. Our perceived free will could possibly be condensed to a few pages of equations. 

Fortunately the first assumption made is most likely false as the on the subatomic level a lot of processes seem to be very random and unpredictable.In chess, there are 169,518,829,100,544,000,000,000,000,000 ways to play the first ten moves.From /r/mathjokes :

25-55+(85+65)=5! I know it is hard to believe [The Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)

or [The Birthday Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)The fractions 1/7, 2/7 ... 6/7 all share the same sequence (142857) but start at a different point. So:

1/7 = 0.142857...

2/7 = 0.285714...

3/7 = 0.428571...

4/7 = 0.571428...

5/7 = 0.714285...

6/7 = 0.857142...

This actually translates to others sets of fractions (try it with 1/13, 2/13 etc. and a different pattern will show up). The length of the sequence is at most equal to the denominator minus 1. It also translates into other numerical systems. You can try 1/5, 2/5, etc. in duodecimals (base 12) and you'll get a repeating pattern of 4 numbers that shows up.6 is afraid of 7 because 7,8,9the equation a^n+b^n=c^n doesn't have a solution for n>2.4(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...) = piMaybe not my favorite, but a good one is the central limit theorem. Not only is it an astonishing result about pdfs and pmfs in general, but it being true mathematically also leads to extremely useful results.

Its hard to appreciate it without some background in probability and statistics. Basically, the start of probability theory is the sample space. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes. Any subset of the sample space (including the sample space itself) is called an *event*. For example, picking a card might have the sample space defined as {H,D,C,S} for hearts, diamonds, clubs or spades. The sample space is also sometimes called the *certain event* as it is the event which is bound to occur, like getting any suit is bound to occur. Then for any event in the sample space, you define a probability function such that the probability of any event is greater than or equal to zero, and the probability of the certain event is 1. 

After that you define random variables (usually denoted by a capital letter like X), which are functions from the sample space to the set of real numbers. Basically its a thing that instead of talking about the probability that an event is something like heads or tails, you talk about the probability of the value of the random variable being in some interval on the real number line. Then you define something called a probability density function (pdf) so that the area under the curve over some interval is the probability that the value of the random variable is in that interval, so the area under the curve from -infinity to +infinity is 1. These random variables have moments, the most familiar are the mean and variance. The mean is what you expect X to be, and the variance is what you expect the average squared error from the mean of X to be. Then if you have a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables Xi of length n, (independent meaning the value of one doesnt affect the value of the other) each with mean mu and variance = sigma^2 . then define a random variable Xbar_n defined by the 1/n times the sum of all the X_is, then a random variable Z by Z = (Xbar_n - mu)/(sigma/sqrt(n)). As n gets larger and larger, the probability density function of Z is a normal pdf with mean 0 and variance 1. This is true for any random variable with any pdf, so long as the mean and variance are finite.It's possible to construct a ball such that the radius is 2 and the diameter is 1.



The short of it is that you put the globe in a discrete metric space and let the radius be 2.  So now every point less than 2 distant from your center is in the ball - that is, every point in the discrete metric space is in the ball.  Diameter is defined in this case as the distance between the two points that are the furthest apart, and as all distances are 0 or 1, your diameter is 1.  Any number is divisible by 3 if you can sum up the digits and get a number divisible by 3.

e.g. 12345: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 and 15 / 3 = 5

e.g. 15: 1 + 5 = 6 and 6 / 3 = 2You can approximate the conversion from miles to kilometers with the Fibonacci sequence:
2 mi ~ 3 km, 3 mi ~ 5 km, 5 mi ~ 8 km, etc. (1+2+3+4 + ..... + n) ^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3

What's weird about this is that there don't seem to be such nice relations with any of the other (1 + ... + n)^m or 1^m + 2^m + ... + n^m expressions. The equation above is the only obvious one like it.I got dropped off at her house to meet her parents for the first time & then take her to the movies. I'd just gotten my driver's license, but I didn't have a car, so if I recall correctly, the plan was to have her folks drop us off at the theater after proper introductions were made. My mom drops me off in front of a dark house in a gated community... I walk up to the front door & knock. Through the window, I can see that a solitary light is on in the rear of the house. After a moment, the door opens & my date's mom greets me & tells me my date is still getting ready, but would I like to come in & meet her father? Sure, says I, and proceed to follow her into the house towards the light. 

As I approach, sitting at the kitchen table under the solitary light is a HUGE man in his late 40s, easily over 250 pounds. He's dressed like an extra from Goodfellas: perfectly coiffed salt & pepper hair perched over a massive head adorned with a mustachioed visage that has obviously seen a few bouts of violence in its years, huge gold cross on a thick gold chain around his neck, hands the size of Christmas hams, wearing a polo shirt stretched over his enormous paunch like a second skin. Perched next to this monster is a black cane with a silver goose head handle that looks as if it has been chosen more for its bludgeon applications than as a walking aid. He is counting out a very large stack of $100 bills. Next to him on the table is a holstered. 357. He has a giant pinky ring on that looks designed to crush skulls with each pimp slap. Mind you, at the time I was a skinny little high school delinquent: 120 pounds soaking wet, terrible neckbeard, dressed like I just came from a Phish concert in cutoff corduroys & birkenstocks-- an obvious teenage pothead &  oh-just-by-the-way also Jewish. The man before me was a walking nightmare & I figured I was the last guy he wanted showing up at his house asking about his oldest daughter. 

He doesn't look up from his count & asks me to sit. I plant myself at the table with visions of being forced to dig my own grave dancing in my head. The mom has disappeared, I am alone with him. He runs through the typical questions a parent asks: where my folks live, what they do, what I plan to do after high school, etc. and the entire time I'm convinced this man is a mafioso & thus I'm sweating over each answer as if my life depended on it. After what seemed like an eternity, my date-- his daughter-- came downstairs with her mom & I stood to leave. As we were making our way towards the door, her dad calls to me & when I turn around, he suddenly tosses his car keys to me & tells me to take his car, a massive Crown Vic. I was so amped up with fear that I actually caught the keys (normally I'm uncoordinated enough that throwing anything to me would result in both the thrown object's likely destruction as well as anything in my immediate vicinity as I attempted to make the catch). We hightail it out of there & leave in his car. 

Needless to say, I spent the night driving well under the speed limit & keeping my hands off his daughter, which years later I realized was his plan all along.First time I met a former girlfriend's mother, she said "My kids won't tell me so maybe you can - what's a 'dirty sanchez?'"

My now husband used to sneak me into his parents place late at night so we could get down to naked shenanigans without having to pay for a hotel. His parents are usually out of the house by 830 so it was never an issue. Well. One morning after he had snuck me in, we discovered that his father had taken a personal day. We knew there was no way to sneak me out unnoticed, so I just sat down with a cup of coffee like I was supposed to be there all along. His dad walked up to me and patted me on the head and walked back into his bedroom. I was mortified. When I met my in-laws, they weren't very welcoming at all.  My mother-in-law believes that she's a prophet of God and that she receives messages from him.  Apparently God told her that I wasn't the right woman for her son and that I'd lead him to a life of misery. Also I dress like a whore and it's probably because my father molested me.  - That's the in-law's theory on it anyway, I wasn't actually molested.  I was just wearing a white v-neck blouse and a pair of jeans but I guess that's what all the whores wear these days. We were caught at 3am having sex in his garden. 

He was hanging out of me when his parents triggered the outdoor floodlight, we got up and brushed ourselves off and they were basically like "...what the fuck..."So I was with an Indian girl a few years back, and she said her parents (particularly her father) were a bit old fashioned etc etc despite living in the UK for over 20 years. I was expecting maybe them being a bit blunt towards me when they met me or maybe even lots and lots of questions in order to judge me. What I didn't expect was the reaction to be 'you are not to see him again, he is white' and the door basically being closed in my face.  So my now husband was only separated when we started dating. We met his mom at a buffet restaurant for lunch with some of her church friends on a Sunday. The first thing she says (at double volume) is,  "Can I  ask your girlfriend about your wife?"

The looks I got from the family in the next booth were rather scathing but the church friends were all cool. When they told me I better not get her pregnant like her ex did. That was the night I found out she had an abortion in high schoolMy girlfriend had me over for dinner at her parent house for the first time. Steak dinner with all of the fixins'. I take my first bite, swallow, immediately start choking. I'm so scared that I'm going to make a bad impression, so I took a drink of water to try to wash it down. Didn't work, so after about fifteen seconds without a single breath my face turns red, so I start freaking out an point at my throat. So my girlfriends mom does the Heimlich maneuver and I throw up all over the floor. Her two miniature schnauzers start licking up the aftermath, girlfriend's dad puts his napkin down and leaves the room.I was dating a girl who was super cool and we had halloween plans.  I dressed as a breathalyzer machine that was in our local college bar.  It was coin operated and had the words "blow before you go" scrolling on an LED screen which we all thought was hilarious.  I had that written on my costume and it was also coin operated and you can imagine where I put the mouth piece.  When I picked her up her parents were having a Halloween party and they asked me what my costume was (I couldn't wear it driving).  I told them vaguely but they LOVED the idea and would not drop it.  They made me put it on and paraded me around the party to everyone.  I had a dozen seniors ask me what "blow before you go" meant although some dirty old men got it and loved it.  It was brutal, but in the end it worked :)More like meet the family. My ex from high school was the youngest of 9 kids. I was invited over for dinner and it was just me, him, his mom, and his 5 brothers. They were making jokes the whole time under their breath and the mom would give them the evil eye. I was only 14 and so nervous that I was shaking. 

Then his mom says to me, "so your mom tells me you're getting braces soon?" The brothers all look up and are trying to stifle their laughter. One of them asks me when I'm getting them. I tell him 2 weeks. He looks at my boyfriend and says "well, two weeks to get as many blowjobs as you can, bud. After that your dick will be mangled." His mom kicked him out of the kitchen and I sat there trying not to laugh/cry the rest of the silent dinner. An old roommate's story:

He snuck in and spent the night with his girlfriend.  Her family was going on a trip early the next morning.  My friend proceeded to have loud nasty sex in the morning.  She got up and went to the shower, he decided to search the house for food.  Still naked he parkoured down the stairs and over the rail with a dismount onto the living room floor.  Mom, dad and little brother were having silent rage breakfast after being kept up half the night and woken up by sex.

My roommate was such a dick boyfriend that he was the straw that broke the camels' back for her parents relationship and his name was brought up in the divorce.My husband's best friend had to have his future mother-in-law bail him out of jail for a DUI during their first date. She was the only one they could get a hold of (pre cell phones) as we were all going from a wedding to the reception.  

Also,  not first meeting,  but second or third maybe... My mother was visiting and shared my queen size bed with me and my future husband had gotten drunk so I made him stay over and sleep on the sofa.  He tried climbing in bed with me by crawling over my mother and then yelled at her because someone was in bed with his girlfriend.  He said he sobered up instantly and couldn't go back to sleep he was so mortified.  

Apparently he hadn't come out yet..My girlfriend at the time, we met abroad, dated coming home and did long distance for awhile. She was born in Russia, and her father was VERY russian. They spoke only Russian to each other, not english. 

We were both on break from college and flew into where her dad lived, and picked us up. First time ever meeting him. They spoke russian the entire ride from the airport to his house. I would hear my name occasionally and nothing more. 

He is somewhat shy, but as a full Russian dude, that's incredibly terrifying. Barely spoke a word to me the whole first day/night I was there. 

The 2nd night at dinner he brought out a bottle of vodka and only 2 shot glasses, 1 for me and 1 for him. 

I think we had 6-7 shots during the meal, several more after dinner. After that dinner, we were best friends. After spending five hours in the Detroit airport, because we missed our flight due to the first flight running late.  We finally land and all we want to do is get something to eat and get some rest.  Her mother who I'm meeting for the first time has decided that we're going out to eat with my future wife's sister, her boyfriend, her friend, and her boyfriend.  My wife just wanted to go back to their place and relax.  This started a huge fight between the two.  

We ended up going out to eat with everyone.  Her sister's friend made everything awkward and pretty much threw a fit the entire time.  

I was there for three days and by the end of it her mother was giving me dirty looks and telling me about how the plan was for my wife and her sister to get married and live down the street from each other.  Her mom decided that slamming on the brakes while driving down the road would be a good idea.  She got pissed for some reason and decided that she had to drive us all home drunk.  When we got out of the car, I tried to help her and she got mad.

I witnessed her flip out at my wife, myself, and her husband because he was just sitting there for three days.  As we were leaving she shook my hand and told my wife that she needed to make a decision that it was either myself or her family.The first time I met my then-boyfriend's mother, she didn't address me directly, or speak English in front of me.  She told her son (my boyfriend) in Spanish that I had good birthing hips, and asked if I was pregnant yet.  She said she wanted a white grandchild.  If only her son had told her that I spoke enough Spanish to understand her.  Wow.My wife and I started dating in our 20s, but we had known each other since high school. I went over to her parent's house for dinner after we had been dating for about a month. I'm talking to her dad and brother-in-law and less than five minutes into the conversation he looks at me and says with a big smile, "we're related you know". We live in a small town and this was always a big fear of mine. My then future father-in-law explained how his grandmother and my great-grandfather were brother and sister or something like that. My brother in law still gives me shit about it almost ten years later. First was fun. Apparently she was a daughter of an important guy. When we came to her home i did not know that, he and his wife were drunk and when we talked a bit they asked me to dump her as she's not worth it. Apparently she did not have good relationship with them. It was weird. Taught me that some families are really weird. Especially when i was inside her under blanket and her dad decided to come in and discuss money matters aggressively. I was 17 and she was 21 so only later i understood how fucked up everything was.. 

Second time i met only the father. He did not know my occupation and straight out said "most of all i hate IT workers, all they do is just walk around looking bossy doing nothing and getting huge money for doing shit, you agree?" And my ex just told him that I'm an IT consultant. Now that was awkward.I was 18 and dating this girl from a pretty fucked up family with a very Catholic mother. My girlfriend's neglectful biological father had been replaced with an innocent and caring step dad, 10 years younger than her mother, that was basically her sock puppet. One of the kids raised as her brother was actually her runaway older brother's 5 year old son. Anyway, I am an atheist, something my girlfriend had probably failed to keep to herself, and I had been invited over by her to come in late at night when everyone was asleep and leave before people would get up on a fairly regular basis, and this may have set the tone for when I was actually allowed to first be around during daylight... One day, almost a year into the relationship, I was invited to the breakfast table (by my girlfriend, who explained that her parents would be okay with it). "Would he like some coffee" is how they would communicate with me, very sparingly. After the subjectively longest breakfast of my life, with no conversation to speak of that would involve me directly, her mother asks "did you invite HIM to your birthday party with the family?", to which she responds, naturally, "yes". To which her mother turns around, looking at her de facto husband/boy toy, and with a clear expression of disgust, complains "she has done it again! She hasn't asked us!".

And so we went back to me showing up in the middle of the night, and leaving before dawn...I met my wife's mother the day she was diagnosed with aggressive late-stage cancer.At Christmas, MIL takes a single strand of long golden hair off of my husband's (then boyfriend's) jacket and asks him where this came from. I knew his exGF of 5 years had long golden hair and he just took the thing out of the closet for the first time in a long time, but she did it to try to phase me.

Should have run then.My boyfriend "Jeff"at the time dropped by on Christmas Day to give me a present. He had brought his five year old little sister, "Kimmie" with him. My entire extended family was all gathered around, sizing him up, etc. when his little sister started tugging on his arm and saying over and over, "Jeeeeefffff!! Can we go now?" To which he acted annoyed and said, "in a little bit, Kimmie." But she persisted and he kept saying, "in just a minute, hon..." Finally, I guess she couldn't help herself, because in exasperation she threw back at him: "Jeff!! Remember in your car - before we came up here, YOU TOLD ME TO BEG!!!" And you could have heard a pin drop. His face was bright red as he said a feeble awkward goodbye and shuffled off. Everyone in the room didn't know what to say or where to look. LOLI was 15 and I met his mom for the first time. I was pregnant and he said she knew. Had a discussion with her and my mom to explain I was considering adoption. She didn't know and was devastated.I met the entirety of my boyfriend's family without him, about a month after we started dating. 

He was in Atlanta for health reasons, so I decided I would go up and visit whenever I could. I wanted to just book a hotel but his mom insisted I just stay with her at her sister and brother-in-law's house. It wasn't a big deal, aside from the fact that I have horrible social anxiety and I'd never travelled alone before or stayed anywhere without my parents. So I met his aunt, uncle, mother, father, and cousin in Atlanta and nearly had a panic attack. They kept paying for things for me. They took me to historical societies, museums, dinners, lunches, pedicures. I was floored because I'm not entirely well off in comparison and I feel just terrible being spoiled by the family of a boy I'd only just started dating. And they kept asking me questions and never let me sleep in past 6 for some reason. 

On the way home, I drove with his mom instead of flying. She took me to a peach orchard and kept telling me that she was so happy to have me in his life because I was the most stable thing so far and I was all he talked about. Same day, she decided to stop at her parents house. So I met his other aunt, his sister, his brother, and his grandparents. 

Meeting your boyfriend's family without your boyfriend is a very horrifying experience when you're a socially anxious poor girl, basically. When I met my ex's dad, he gave me a double handed handshake that turned into a lingering caress as he checked me out top to bottom (I'm female). Skeezy as fuck, and my ex was just like "Yeah, he's kind of creepy but probably harmless."When I first met my high school girlfriend's parents, I plugged their toilet.Met exes mother.

She drove us from the station to her house.

During the car ride, she spoke to my ex about me in the third person, as though I didn't exist. I don't have any bad stories, but my mom's is pretty bad. Apparently, my dad's parents told her she wasn't "submissive" enough because she asked my dad to put the towels in the laundry instead of doing it herself like a proper christian woman. She also didn't wake up on time (5am, and she was not alerted of this). But instead of eating without her or waking her up, my dad's parents sat there for almost an hour with the food waiting for my mom to get up. 

The only reason she stayed with my dad after that weekend is because my dad is the exact opposite of his parents and they wouldn't have to visit that often. I had dinner with her and her dime piece mom at Applebees. On the ride home I texted my friend to tell him how much of a MILF my new gf's mom was. I sent it to my gf on accident who was sitting in the front. She turns around and says "you just sent that to me" awkwarness all the way homeI have all of you beat. I stabbed her dad. 

When I had just turned 18, I started dating a girl who's dad was a wannabe badass (from the stories she said before I met him and the time I spent with him afterward.). 

I should add that I carried around a push dagger. I wasn't 21 and couldn't carry yet, so I thought if I needed anything, I'd at least have a push dagger. I took some classes and was pretty damn dangerous with it, practicing at home when I could. 

So I was supposed to meet my girlfriend and her parents for dinner after work. So I came around in my work clothes and her dad took me on a tour of his garage to see his restored GTO and gun collection. I had been through this before with my HS girlfriend, but I wasnt expecting him to pull out a gun and put it in my face. I grabbed my push dagger and hit him in the stomach while I pushed his arm out of the way, disarmed him, and held him at gun point with his own gun while I called the cops. It was all so quick and kind of instinctual. Girlfriend and mom came in, mom screamed. 

After a couple days of him hating my guts, he finally apologized. Said that it was his fault for putting a gun in my face. Never once questioned my intentions with his daughter or my ability to protect her when we were out. My boyfriends mother was a narcissistic parent and REALLY didn't want me dating him. There wasn't really a 'meeting the parents' because we had to keep things secret but when our relationship was found out she threatened to kill me, report me to the police and a whole mess of stuff. We don't speak to that lady :)More than 20 years ago. Still a fresh wound. Had a date for the Homecoming dance but couldn't drive yet. Decided to double date with a guy from class. His date turned out to be an exchange student with little English. We arrived at the restaurant before the dance to find a table for 6. Me, my friend, our dates, and his Scientologist parents who spent the dinner interrogating all of us.I was finger banging his daughter when he walked down the stairs. We didn't hear him, so here I am playing tonsil hockey with his daughter - hands down her pants when he says "I think it's time for the guys to leave" (My cousin was with her friend on the other couch) so  I just pulled my hands out of her pants, wiped it on my jeans, said bye and turned around and walked away.  

She ended up being grounded for 6 months, so I didn't see or hear from her for a long time (we lived in different cities).  I ran into her about a year later and she told me about how much trouble she got in.  Oh, high school....Ugh. Not the parents but the whole family. 

I had just gotten out of a relationship, and I really didn't want to start meeting everyone right away. My current boyfriend still lived at his family's house at the time, and I had spent the night on his birthday for obvious reasons.

It's been about three months, and I hadn't met his family (they were vaguely aware of a "female" that occasionally stayed over, but work schedules made it easy for us to stay as private as possible, and they didn't pry). Well he said almost every year on his birthday, they go to a late dinner and that's that. Great, no pressure.

Well they decided to shake it up, and mom, dad, grandparents, sister, brother, brother in law, niece and nephew all come marching in around 9AM with cake and balloons and shit and started singing. 

My head was under the covers the whole time, with him just laying there propped up. Finally they stop singing, and I pop up, just to look, and everyone gasps, and grandma leaves muttering. His sister started "whooping" at us and laughing, and the kids just didn't understand. Everyone left the room, and I snuck out the window.

He got a 30 mixed pack of condoms and lube from his sister later that day. Ugh.I don't know if this counts, but my ex girlfriend's father called me by her ex's name for a good three, four months... we have the same last name... and he bullied me years before. My girlfriend and I are long distance. She came down to my town to get me. She brought her mother who I meet for the first time. She (her mother) flirted with me for pretty much the entire three hour car ride. I didn't know that was happening until my girlfriend told me about it after she and I dropped her mom off at her mother's house (I am one of those who doesn't notice female interest unless they make it completely obvious. Though by then I was extremely uncomfortable. I had a rip in one of the two layers my shorts on my upper thigh. She stuck her finger in the rip of my shorts. Very creeped the fuck out just thinking about it. The TIFU where the guy pretends to not know what a potato is, but has to play it out and look like an idiotUgh, when I was in college I had IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Every time I ate a meal, I had to poop afterwards. Sometimes, they were violent and uncontrollable. 

Fast forward to my senior year. I travel down to Florida to visit my GF and her very proper family (I'm from Ohio). She grilled me on table manners, what to say, what not to say blah blah blah all that stuff. Well, I had been acing the entire trip. Her mother liked me. I watched the Rose Bowl with her step dad (Texas vs USC), he was stoked that he could finally talk football with someone. Her little brother and sister? Wrestling around with them in no time.

Then, her mother decided to cook a 'traditional' meal one night. Halfway through the meal it hits me: a stage 5 shit just dropped into my bowels. If I didn't get to a toilet within five minutes this would occur: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9lU6UyTdiM

I politely excuse myself and find the bathroom furthest from the dining room. It didn't matter. The house was ranch style with stone floors and a layout perfectly enhancing the acoustics of what was about to happen.

Once I returned to the table her mother asks,"was it my cooking?" We spoke about my IBS for the rest of dinner. FML. My boyfriend said we were going to see his parents. We were in that cemetery  for like an hour[Relevant video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlVKVGShx84)I was telling one of his parents about a time my face swelled up due to chronic hayfever and FOR SOME REASON, I chose to make a down syndrome reference (I know it's not funny I panicked)

But yeah that parent had down syndrome siblings and didn't find it funny at all.Well not when we first met, but still. I had no plans for a Saturday evening so I decided to get drunk. Then he calls me and says he's bringing me to his house for dinner. I tell him no way, I'm drunk. He thinks that's hilarious and won't take no for an answer. Sure enough, I end up at his house, still intoxicated. When I drink, I lose my balance a lot and make little sense when I talk. I kept very still and quiet, hopefully his mom didn't notice.Not me but my padre. He was in college and talking to a girl who ended up inviting him over for dinner. She warned him that her father had lost his legs in Vietnam. Mi padre, being the joker he is, goes on and asks her, "Did he ever find em?". 
So once they head over to the dinner, the father opens the door, in a wheelchair, looks at my padre and just gives him the look of death. 
Ended up okay though, her dad was really quite a comic and they ended up getting along. Dated this girl for a few months and one day she invited me to come to a BBQ at her moms place where she had a couple things she needed to grab from there anyways.  I agreed and once we arrived I realized it was a family BBQ with a bunch of her relatives there.  This was the first time I had ever met anyone from her family, and her mother introduced me to one of her uncles... "This is uncle Jack, Jack this is Nikki's fiance Adam."  FIANCE??  What the hell?  I was frozen and didn't know what to do so I didn't say anything until after we left.  That relationship barely lasted 6 months.I don't have a *bad* meeting the parents story, just a slightly awkward. My FMIL thought I was Chinese for like the first six months of our relationship. I'm like 150% white, I just have very fair skin, almondish eyes, and colored my hair dark and flat ironed it daily when I was younger. My fianc and I also thought she was calling me lazy for like a year. Turns out she was trying to call me Lacey (not my name) and her accent made it come out as lazy. [Link to my TIFU post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/36nhte/tifu_by_getting_too_high_at_the_beginning_of_a/)


Tl;dr - High school GF and her friend locked herself out of her house, they were drinking so calling parents to let them back in wasn't an option.  My friend and I went and brought them back to my house where they stayed the night with us.  Woke up early in the morning to my dad asking me why the cops think I kidnapped my GF, with her enraged parents (mom mostly) outside my house wanting to break a baseball bat over my skull.


On a better note, her mom and I ended up becoming close and she helped me get connections throughout my career despite being the mother of an ex of which I despise.We all went out to dinner, and the "crazy aunt" who was in town came with us. She was described as the crazy aunt by my girlfriend, and then the aunt actually introduced herself as "crazy aunt Margaret." she insisted I call her "crazy aunt Margaret" and nothing else. Even my go to of "mam" was shot down. 

Anyway dinner comes to a close and the waiter brings out the bill and sets it on the table by the parents. Crazy aunt bitchtits snatches it and hands the bill directly to me. I usually offer to pay for my own food when I'm out with people, but I had kinda picked up on the fact that the mom was paying for everything. I had even thanked them for taking me out. 

I stammered out "I uh, can pay for my meal..." and the aunt from hell said "oh you can't afford to pay for this? Why did we come here?" 

Today there are a million things I'd have loved to do instead of what I did do, which was take out my mom's credit card and shakily put it in the black thingy (is there a word for that?). 

Finally the mom comes to my rescue and lightly tells off her sister, playing it off as a silly joke. She takes the bill and assures me that they would not ask me to pay, and I felt the weight lift off my shoulders. The aunt agreed that she was joking and wouldn't do that, but I felt some serious hostility from her after that. Met her parents but they insisted on inviting me to dinner, which was nice but I was really stoned. During the meal I launched into a long rambling anecdote about something, before realizing I'd ended it with "...and that was the most beers I've ever drunk in one day". They were not happy.When I met my ex he had recently left the cult he'd been raised in and his relationship with his father, who was still a member, was kind of weird even besides that (I later found out the father wasn't even emotionally equipped to raise a goldfish let alone a person but anyway).

So we get there and pretty much immediately my boyfriend and his dad start talking about all kinds of weird shit that's apparently run-of-the-mill conversation.  Like a play that the father recently saw (put on by other cult members) depicting the two Jesuses and their lives as described in the Bible.  Then a little while later this woman comes downstairs wearing a bathrobe and pajama bottoms.  She was about 25, so only a few years older than boyfriend and I.  I assumed that this was the father's girlfriend, but I quickly learned she was his *roommate* and had taken boyfriend's room after he moved out.  The three of them begin discussing weird cult stuff I can't follow.

Then later the father's girlfriend did come over.  This woman was unfortunately the ugliest person I have ever seen in my entire life, and she was starring daggers at the father's "roommate" the whole time.  At this point someone gets the idea that we should all go out to dinner.  The father's girlfriend tries to talk the roommate out of joining but she runs upstairs, gets dressed, and gets in the car with us just in time.

The restaurant we ended up at was also cult-owned cause the majority of the town was populated by these folks.  They have very particular beliefs about farming and the menus advertised that the meat and vegetables had all come from the appropriate sources.  Dinner conversation is mostly trying to explain the tenants of this religion to me when I confessed that I didn't really "get it," with the girlfriend and the roommate trying to one-up each other with their knowledge. [This](https://i.imgur.com/7AnmKrA.gif)Um...not when I first met them but when my mom did...my boyfriend's mother started going on about an old high school friend of ours (and my current nemesis) and how she always hoped my nemesis would have gotten together with my boyfriend...my mom just smiled and laughed and never said a word about it to me. I was like...thanks mom for your support. Hahaha! It was super awkward. My parents didn't meet my ex boyfriend until I had broken up with him, been miserable for a while, befriended him again, and come out as lesbian (to them but not him yet). That was one of the most awkward days I can remember. The first time I went home to my ex was pretty late on a friday, so after work. She'd timed it so she would have time to get home from work before I would be there, so all was cool. Except that she was running late after work. And didn't tell me. So I show up at her house and ring the bell, expecting her to answer. Nope, it's her mom. So I get invited inside and end up sitting on the couch and watching TV and awkwardly smalltalking with her parents for half an hour before she gets home. Pretty sure that's one of the most awkward moments of my life.When his mother kept calling me by his ex's name. Repeatedly. No matter how many times I said "no, actually, I'm Fifi"....the last time I corrected her she just said "oh well, no point learning your name, you won't be around long enough!"...she was right.Her stepdad started showing me his automatic rifles. The laser sight was cool.....Met my friend's parents... they seemed nice, but quiet old. My friend went up stairs, grabbed a trumpet, and started blasting from atop the stairs while his father tried to ignore him and eat his dinner in peace. 

We are no longer friends.I met went over my ex's mom's for dinner for his birthday (his dad was deceased ) and we were chatting and i mentioned our grandmother's last names were the same.

She says oh maybe you're related and it was at that point I realized my bf had not told her we were dating.

She seemed kind of aloof but I withdrew the "girlfriend" vibe and became the most pleasant dinner guest EVER.

I didn't ask the boyfriend about it for a few days- he didn't think it was necessary info for her to have.

We are no longer together. Mostly because he's a fucking idiot.First date, mom and dad both came to the door.  Farted loudly, mom laughed so hard she was still wiping tears when we left.My ex's deadbeat dad (she was living with her aunt and uncle) tried to intimidate me into making rules about what ***I*** was allowed to do in my own house. I laughed at him right to his face. He was not happy about that, at all, but I can recognize a blowhard when I meet one. He then talked to my father, who also laughed at him, though not until he was out of earshot. My dad has better self-control than me. Dated girl for about 5 months, asked her to Homecoming. We decided to ditch Homecoming and go walk around outside the school before she decided to go down on me. We were caught by the principle who made us sit in the office until Her parents were called in to pick her up where the principle explained to her parents everything she saw.

I was more concerned as to why the principle was able to recall things we specifically did over the course of 15 minutes, which meant she was watching for at least that long before catching us. Her parents didn't seem to share my concerns.I was out with my friend a couple months ago when he realised he needed to grab a phone charger from his dad's flat. He said to me that we could go in and have a chat with him while we were there, and so I was pretty psyched to meet him.

When we got their, his dad was asleep and came to open the door in just boxers and socks. My friend went to his room to get his charger, and for some reason I entered the flat and started making small talk. It wasn't until a few minutes in that I realised my friend was out of the place while I was chatting with this small, bald, half-naked guy I've just met.Went out to dinner, got some bad seafood, spent an hour absolutely destroying their hotel room's toilet. Not the most auspicious start, that.So this is already late and I know it won't be read but here goes anyway... 

So this girl I was seeing had divorced parents. One time I was staying at her mom's house (this was the first time I had met either parent) and all went over well more or less with the mom. I stayed over that night and of course we were hooking up. Anyway, the next morning I go downstairs in nothing but sleep pants and I see this guy in the kitchen. Having heard the night before that they were getting some work done on the house, I assumed it was the maintenance guy and I addressed him by saying "Hey man, what's up?" in short casual just standing there with no shirt on and drinking coffee. Again imagine we've never met each other. Then my girlfriend at the time comes in the room and I grab her ass and start to dry hump in front of him. I'm thinking its the maintenance guy who cares right? He knows I'm fucking this girl and plus we were often passionate several times a day at that time, so we might have gone back to bed. 

Anyway, as this is happening I catch her eye and she seems oddly uncomfortable and this 'maintenance' guy is giving me a grin which says "I fucking hate you". Then this guy's new wife and their kid walk into the room... now I start to realize "oh SHIT that's her fucking DAD!" (she had mentioned the new wife a few times and I immediately recognized the kid from the pictures of her step brother that she had shown me).

Well in short, we broke up soon after, and I was never invited to either of the parents' houses again. It was too bad because I really liked her and I know her dad (who was a really conservative guy btw) mentioned that incident on several occasions afterwards and likely influenced her decision to stop seeing me :(In high school I started dating my neighbor. A few days into our relationship she was ignoring her dad's calls and texts (unbeknownst to me.) He shows up at my house furious demanding to see his daughter. That was a bit awkward to say the leastHer dad told me "Get out while you still can". Should have listened to him. Instead I was with an awful woman for three years.    I met my current GF's mom in the waiting room while she was getting a colonoscopy. I was 16, I met my girlfriend's Mom for the first time. I had a bunch of hickeys on my neck, which she pointed out. Awkward.Pardon my language but I met the girl in college and she ended up living 6 hours away from me.  I went to meet the parents in bum fuck middle of nowhere and pull up and the first thing her dad asks me is "what are you? A fucking n***** lover?" Because I was wearing a Charlotte Hornets shirt. He then proceeded to show me his extra building full of guns and tell me that he wasn't racist but that he hated "all the other people" the same.It was Easter, his mom was insanely drunk when I got there and started talking shit the second I walked through the door. I didn't make conversation at the table once because she was just yapping away and his dad just really didn't care Her dad was a HUGE Rush Limbaugh fan. Oh man, story time.
So I went to this summer camp every summer. At age 15 I meet this cute girl, she's a bit older and we hit it off. Week ends, we say lovingly say bye and exchange contact information. Turns out she lives like 25 miles away so not so bad but no car that a bit of a ways. 

We talk on the phone for about two weeks when I get it in my head to ride my bike all the way to her house. I'm exhausted when I get there but hey, boner force is the strongest force on earth. We start making out in her tree house for a while, a few articles of clothes come off and I'm thinking I'm the man, when her father pops in and coughs. Then says menacingly "umm you need to go". 

I freak out and leave, worried she's gonna get into trouble or if i stayed i'd get an beating. I leave a message with her neighbor saying all the stupid shit a 15yr old would say and begin riding back to my house, exhausted, pissed, annoyed etc. Thankfully I got a ride back from a kind stranger. Then dated her for about 2 years so not so bad.

TLDR Meet girl, ride bike 25 miles to see her, dad interrupts make out session,  still dated her for 2 yearsMy in-laws refused to come to our wedding ... and my MIL didn't call me anything but "that girl" until after we'd been married 7 years or so.  I come from a big, loud, redneck, welcoming family ... they were the very quiet, stare at new people and don't talk kind. I'm glad I'm divorced and don't have to deal with those weirdos anymore!So it was my girlfriends birthday party and her dad just got home, it was my first time ever seeing him. I didn't know he was there. So me, my girlfriends, and her friends are on the couch watching tv. Me and her are cuddling but she wanted to switch sides and her face happened to be right about my crotch so I said "Hmm, this position seems familiar" Her dad walked by the moment I said that.The guy who didn't know about potatoes probably wins this thread I came home from a day concert tripping balls to find my GFs parents had made a surprise trip to meet me. It was a long day. I thought her mother was her father. She is a chain smoker and has a really low voice due to it. Half way into dinner, than her family dog of about 15years keeled over and died.My buddy and I graduated this weekend, so we went and got hammered last Thursday.  So we get back to his place, he goes to bed and I crash on the couch.  So the next morning at like 9 his parents get to his place like 2 hours early, only to see me blearily looking at them, with my vomit on the floor.  And that's how I met my buddies parents.  He was so hungover for graduation, and I was still drunk until like 2 in the afternoon.  Good times hahaShe was sick, and I was coming over to take care of her/cuddle to make her feel better. Found out that her parents were there when I was already half way there. Ended up having an awkward dinner with them, and I could tell they didn't like me. I ended up leaving because her parents were being persistent about her doing chores.  

We broke up a few weeks later, and her mom stills says hi for whatever reason.

EDIT: I was also the first boyfriend her parents had met.When her dad found my condoms that I left in her car after we had sex. I had to come pick them up from her house and got the coldest stare from her dad when I walked in lol.met my ex's family as his dads funeral...roughWhen I met my SO's mom for the first time, she was in the middle of getting kicked out of her apartment with her developmentally challenged, 28 year old, son. I spent my first day with them moving all their stuff into a storage unit. She went between freaking out, bawling and then pretending like nothing was happening. It was pretty fucking real.I was picking up a girl on our first date back in high school. Rang the doorbell at her house, her dad opened and let me in, she was still getting ready (of course). He invited me to sit down in the living room with him and a friend of his. 

After a few perfunctory "how's school?" type questions, he asked me what I would do if I had a brand-new Mustang and a stranger came up to me at a gas station and asked if he could take my car out for a ride. Then he asked why he should let me take his daughter out. After that he asked what would happen if I died and St. Peter asked me why I should be let into heaven (the correct answer was "I've accepted Jesus Christ as my lord and savior"). Great start. Girlfriend's parents thought I was her gay friend. She didn't deny it. Dated a girl whose parents are from Puerto Rico. They were very kind too my face, but spoke in Spanish openly while I was there. I asked the girl what they were saying, and she said it was just a discussion about grocery shopping. I understand Spanish, they were talking about how disappointed that their daughter was dating a girl, and a white girl at that. And they thought I was ugly. That was an uncomfortable dinner. I used to be a host at a local Mexican restaurant. I'd work real long hours and to keep myself entertained I would act like very gay and introduce myself as a hostess and all this other stuff. It became a running gag with the wait staff and host staff. Anyway, I'm about to pick a girl up for a date and I'm running late so I tell her I need to wear my work clothes which reek of Mexican food, then I'll change and we can go see 300 (so it's like 2006 I guess?). Anyway, I show up at their door and her step dad answers and instantly recognizes me as the gay host from the Mexican joint. I seat tons of people so I didn't recognize him. Apparently I say them that night as a "hostess" and they told me I could bring her back whenever I wanted. No specific time... Cause unbeknownst to me.. They thought I was gay. I found out a week later and I told them about the gag and we all had a good laugh... Was busy getting some when his dad walked in.

Didn't intend on meeting him  while I was spread eagle.I once went out on a date with a guy from work - I was a waitress and he worked in the kitchens - in fact I think he just offered to give me a lift home and we ended up going out for a drink, and before we had that drink, he took me Hom to quickly meet his mum who I awkwardly held s very strange conversation with for about 15 minutes while he stood there staring at us and smiling and then we went out for a drink, he dropped me off home afterwards and I stopped talking to him after that. He was really weird.His mom walked in on me sucking his dick... That was funIt wasn't his parents but his Grandma and lots of family in Mexico.I greeted everyone.And was uncomfortable because I don't know Spanish, shy and just a little socially akward.well I go to set on a plastic lawn chair and all four legs just snap.If that isn't horrible enough the flying sardinal makes contact with sweet grandma's leg.Bloody deep scratch...The horror...I was just a little chubby ,not  fat..lol..I was told it wasn't my fault the chair was sun damaged. It was not a first but it was the first time I stayed over.  Got a call on the way home.  "Next time please clean up the used condoms instead of leaving it next to the bed"!not crazy shit or anything but i meet my Former girlfriends Step Father. I walk in and walk over to him to shake his hand and he doesnt even get up from the couch, had absolutely 0 respect for that so called man for the next two and a half years.Went around to meet her folks for the first time, and first thing her old man did was say "come this way". I followed dutifully and he led me to his gun cabinet / cleaning room. Shows me his gun collection and makes me 'pick which gun you'd like to be shot with if you hurt my daughter". 

She cheated on me tho so whatever :/I met my ex's dad when she took me to visit him in prison...I got way too drunk at Oktoberfest and my ex had to rush me out. On our way back to his house, during a drunken breakdown, his father facetimed him. I answered, made an absolute fool of myself, crying and yelling and being an ass. I was sooooo obviously drunk. The kicker? His father was a recovering alcoholic. Sorry Mr. B!Dragging my ex away from my now boyfriends house because he found out i was talking to him and intended to fight him. His dad, a *very very scary* person came out and asked what was going on. Ex and boyfriend were friends before so he recognized me as ex's girlfriend.

Very awkward to explain. 

In a last attempt to get my boyfriend to not be with me he claimed we'd "done stuff" and that I was pregnant. Pretty easy to disprove, but his dad didnt like me for a while. Recently he talked to his family about me and they said they *do* like me but im "too damn quiet for this family"Not me but a guy I know.
Was nervous as hell so he took a loaf of Ketamine. Was sweating like mad when he got to the front door apparently. 
Gf's dad answers the door, guy swings out his arm like a handshake but swung way too fast, smacked his arm against the wall, said "Hey, I did you're daughter" then collapsed. 
They broke up when he got out of hospital.Atheist here. Her dad was super religious.

I'm hoping nothing is brought up during dinner. Then he asks it.

"What's your religion?"

I could've just said Catholic but I wasn't sure if she told her dad already that I was an atheist so I figured fuck it, don't wanna come across as a liar.

I said "I don't really have a religious affiliation." It Sounded nicer than "atheist."

Didn't matter. He looked me in the eye and before I could read his expression, he snatched my fedora, shaved my neckbeard, and dunked his nuts in my mouth.Little late, but here's mine.
I was a sophomore in high school, and I was at her house for the first time. Her dad walked up to me and asked if I could come with him for a second. He walked me into the garage and pulled the door down. With a baseball bat in his hand, he stared at me and said, "Now, I love my daughter very much. If you do anything to make her upset, you will have some very bad consequences." He pointed the bat at me. I laughed nervously, and said, "heh, yes sir. Of course, sir." He then let me go. 

I broke up with her a few days later, fearing for my safety. A few months later, her (new) boyfriend broke up with her after he took a punch to the face.I met my ex's parents at a walk on MLK Jr Day that commemorates the civil rights movement at like 9 AM on a Monday.

Her mom didn't like me because I wasn't religious and immediately after meeting said we must be soulmates sarcastically. I then watched as her ex and his family all showed up because it was tradition for them to do it too and her parents loving that he was there. We then awkwardly went to some random restaurant in what felt like the bottom of an apt complex. Her mom then told me how easy it was for her friend to find a job in my field (I was just out of college) and acted as if it was amazing I had yet to find a job in my field a month out of college.

Basically it was an uphill battle the entire time, and a week later she broke up with me. I'm guessing it had to do with her mom not liking me for being agnostic.A  buddy of mine goes over to his girlfriends house to meet mother and ends up dating both ... GOAL!!!!!It's gonna be a great wall.Star Wars and Star Trek are basically the same thing.

Girls can rely on their milkshakes to bring all the boys to the yard while we guys are left holding the bag of lawn clippings unless we can make you all laugh. [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)

Basically, you can have two data sets that both lead to the same conclusion, but combining them leads to the opposite conclusion.No one goes to that bar. It's always crowded. Definitely the Ship of Theseus paradox-- if you replace all parts of your boat during your voyage, is it still the same boat as the one you left on?  Where I get lost in thought is when applying this to my own body.  Every cell save for your neurons is only around for a maximum of 6 years.  Are you still the same person you were 6 years ago?  Am I actually just my DNA, a set of instructions, or am I just the physical attributes manifested by those instructions?

I have no clue, and neither does anyone else.Medicaid wants my mother to save up $6,000 every 6 months to continue health aide and nursing services, but they want to discontinue services if she has over $2,000 in savings. 

Medicaid doesn't want her to go into a nursing home, but they intercept her income so she can't pay the bills to stay in her home.

WTF Medicaid.A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane in order to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason, and will therefore not be declared insane. Could God microwave a burrito so hot, that he himself could not eat it?Every rule has an exception.

The paradox isn't obvious at first but after thinking about it my head starts to hurt.A man goes to a bookstore and buys Hamlet. He then travels back in time and gives Shakespeare the book before he wrote it, which he copies, word for word. That book is published and eventually lands in the same bookstore. Who wrote Hamlet?If time travel existed and you go back in time to prevent something, it is what causes it in the first place.You're unique...  Just like everyone else. If you strap a piece of buttered toast- face up- to a cats back and drop it. [Hilbert's Hotel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel)


It demonstrates the paradox of a real infinity. A hotel with an infinite number of rooms is filled with an infinite number of guests. The hotel is completely full. 

A new guest comes to check in, at which point the hotel makes another room because there an infinite number of rooms. But the room is full, isn't it? The rooms are filled with an infinite number of guests so they can't accommodate anymore. 

But they have to because there's an infinite number of rooms, right? ITT: people not really knowing what the word paradox meansOpposite Day. The opposite of Opposite Day is just a regular day, no? This was my thinking in Elementary school The only thing that makes you horny (and gives you an erection) is looking at your own flaccid dick live. Space.

I think the Ross-Littlewood Paradox is strange enough. 

Having a vase/bowl that could fit a infinite number of balls. Put in 10 balls and take out 1. However, the time it takes for each step to be completed is half the last step. All of this takes place in one minute. By the end of one minute, some say there are zero balls left in the vase while others say there are infinite in the vase.
This sentence is false.Obviously not created by me but:

In Back to the Future part II, Marty walks in on Biff watching "A Fistful of Dollars" with Clint Eastwood, the scene shows the metal plate that Eastwood uses in a duel to protect himself. Marty clearly sees this scene when he walks in. Fast-forward to BTF Part III and Marty, under the persona as Clint Eastwood, uses the same trick when facing Mad Dog, with lots of people around to watch. This would ensure this never before seen epic would be told for years. Now, if you think about, was Marty technically watching himself in a Fistful of Dollars, from where he learns the same trick?

Infinite loop: Marty learns the trick, creates the moment in the scene, and then would create inspiration for the movie that he would eventually watch and learn the trick again. Rinse and repeat.

How long is a country's coastline? How general or specific do you go when measuring it? Do you track every inlet, curve, of every beach? Depending on how specific you get, the length you end up with can differ by magnitudes. In some cases, it can even double.

So you have something that is somehow both limited (because it has a specific beginning and end point) and infinite.At a subatomic level, during an experiment, the mere presence of the observer observing changes the result, it's called quantum weirdness, wtf is that?I like the Mojverse in X-men's Marvel there are some Paradoxes there.

[Who wrote Beethoven's 5th?](https://vimeo.com/142076226)[deleted]Can god create a stone that is so heavy, even he, the almighty god, cant lift it?Busywork. I hated when teachers would assign things that were menial and we're obviously meant to take up time rather than actually teach us something.Having teachers who had no passion for teaching. 

I had a history teacher who never varied from how she did things. Our chapters were divided into 3 sections; each section ended with a set of questions. 

Monday we had to come in, read section 1, and answer the questions. Even the way we did this was outlined. We had to copy the question word for word, then answer it with a paragraph that was at least 3 sentences long. Even if it were a simple question like on what date did Lincoln give the Gettysburg address? 

We would do the same for section 2 on Tuesday, and section 3 on Wednesday. At the end of each chapter was a set of review questions. Thursday was spent copying and answering those. 

Friday was test day. She'd hand out the test; we had to copy the questions, and answer them the same way we did the homework. 

We weren't allowed to talk to each other. We weren't allowed to ask her questions. We never reviewed anything as a group, or discussed anything we read. If we finished our work we had to sit there with our hands clasped on our desk, facing forward until class ended. 

This was in 11th grade. It was hell. I had other teachers that shouldn't have been teachers, but she was the worst. That the entire hour lesson could be taught in 15 minutes if everyone wasn't disruptive.Group projects. I was always the nerdy one who ended up doing all the work. Other kidsHow shitty kids were to teachers. For some reason it was cool to act like a piece of shit in class. early morningsThe fact that teachers acted as if the class you took with them was the only thing going on in your life.  I played sports, was in the marching band, and had a job.  Getting homework is one thing, but when teachers overload kids for one class, it seemed as if they were unaware of the fact that life happened outside of physics or calculus.Getting up early to go sit on a bus for 20 minutes to go to a place you didn't want to go to.Teachers who clearly had favorites.Standardized testing. It's such a slippery slope. Is it important for students to express their knowledge in a way that can be measured. However, schools no longer teach for the purpose of educating students. Instead, they are preparing students in the art of taking tests.Some of the teachers I had were complete twats.

There were the ones who had become teachers straight after finishing school themselves so had no experience of life outside the confines of a school. They tended to be petty-minded and unimaginative.

There were the jaded ones who had delivered exactly the same lessons for the previous twenty years, wore exactly the same clothes every day and were just serving their time until retirement. They didn't care about the job or the pupils.

There were the vindictive ones who revelled in the power they held over the pupils in their care and took any chance they could to make a snide remark. How insecure in yourself and how unhappy with your lot do you have to be to bully a child?

I had a few good teachers in my time at school. Without exception they were people who had had a career outside teaching and became teachers later in life.Teachers who grade unnecessarily harsh and treat their students like shit in a power trip. 

You're not teaching me that "not everything in life comes easy," you're getting your students beaten at home for "slacking off" when your class is the only one they don't have an A in. If a student is engaged in class and knows the material, they deserve a good grade. Giving over an hour of homework a night, quizzes every day, or teaching at a level much higher than the class is absurd. That grade could be the defining factor in what college a student goes to! 

I've never understood teachers like this. If no one passes your class, you don't look like an under appreciated genius who deserves to work at Harvard, you look like an idiot incapable of doing your JOB, which is teaching kids the material needed to pass your class. What does a grown adult get out of humiliating and ruining the transcript of a teenager? I had way too many teachers like this.The "class is over when I say" teacher. Bitch, why do we have a bell then?How the crushing weight of the classroom setting killed my natural interest in a topic. Having to do homework everyday after school.Needing a hall pass when I went to high school in America. Here in Germany students are treated as young adults instead of children.People with no spatial awareness.
Why is it so hard to step over 2 feet to the side of the hallway and talk to your friends without blocking people's way? I feel like saying "Excuse Me" is a daily occurrence for me to just get to class.How useless the content was in high school, how repetitive it was, how time consuming school was each day. Having to deal with other students.  I think the most sickening was that every teacher drilled into your head that the content was extremely important, that I would use it in my everyday life, but all it would result in was a test that measured the students, and the teachers worth. 
    As a kid who grew up too early, I just wanted school to be over with to get onto my job. To go on to college where I could learn something that applied to what I wanted to be doing, or to actually be respected as a human being rather than what a test score says. 
The other students, They are all a bunch of dickheads it's like a zoo Being on the teacher's shitlist. 

Just because you might have given a bad impression by accident, your reputation is sealed in their minds and it will never change. Now you have to deal with a sociopath for the rest of term :( 


Hearing; "enjoy it while you can, these will be the best years of your lives!" 

Bull fucking shit. I did not enjoy the social pressure, the peer pressure, the pressure to constantly do well on tests, the pressure to appear "cool", constant worry about failing a trivial exam and thinking it will decide the rest of your future. Having no money, having to deal with irrational assholes who will go out of their way to make you feel awful about yourself. Acne. At least we wore uniform, so you didn't have to think about what to wear. In the beginning, I hated going to school. In the end, I hated moving forward.Rules about using the bathroom. I had a teacher who wouldn't let anyone go use the bathroom, ever. She said that's what class changes are for. Understandable, but they gave us 5 minutes to get to your locker and to the next class, impossible to use the bathroom too. One day I had bought two bottles of Fruitopia and I really had to piss... This lady wouldn't let me go... She also didn't like when I pissed in her trash can. The other girls. They were hateful little things.So, so many things place on the level of the thing I hated most.


Teachers who simply didn't care. They didn't put any effort in. They played favorites. They made class miserable for most people. One teacher spent most of the days complaining about us, telling us we were failures, that we're foolish sheep that like to wear the same clothes. (Tshirts, or jeans, or hoodies.) 


We had one great teacher, and she had well behaved classes and the top grades of any classes... Surprising nobody at all. She gave a damn about everyone, and made class interesting.


Physical education. Just... Why? I get it, trying to keep people active and all. But why is it even a class? And WHY is it more important to not miss than others? You could miss up to 8 classes in other subjects before automatically failing it at my high school. You could only miss four PE classes before automatically failing it. How is PE more important than /any/ other subject? Side note, why the hell is it a thing to punish people for not wanting/knowing how to participate in sports? Seriously.


Staff. Most of teachers were lackluster, but not malicious. Just... Passive. Administration on the other hand was where I had the most issues. One vice principle in Middle school, and two vice principles in high school made my life hell. One quite blatantly told me I'd have a free pass if I joined the football team, or he could keep making school difficult for me. I didn't join. He kept his promise.


Punishments. 5 hour detentions sucked. That is all.Just the simple fact that it was required. I know it's an immature trait, but I'm one of those people who HATES something if it isn't my choice.

I loved college, because attending was a choice. I love work, because, even though I technically need a job to survive, I'm still making the choice to go get one.

High school, I had a really shitty attitude, because I hated knowing that attending it was a legal requirement.Having to go to class when you struggle being taught and do much better by yourself learning from a text book.To be honest, myself. I was so worried about how I compared to other people and barely talked to anyone. I kind of wish I could go back with the attitude I have now. I would have probably had a fun time.Not being able to fuck my science teacherA few weeks ago I was in math class (BTW this isn't a regular math class, this is a math class for kids who have trouble in the subject so its a small class of only 7 people including me) A kid was doing a problem on the board and I notice the kid did something wrong on it. I pointed it out and the teacher gave me a point (we have a score board thing where if you do something like that you get a point) and then scolded the rest of the class for not noticing the mistake like I did. And I was just sitting there uncomfortably well he was doing so. People usually feel good when they notice something no one else has, but I don't like it when people try to compare others to me like that.The kid that was clearly the teachers favorite.

Oh look! He won another prize he clearly didn't deserve! Everyone give him a round of applause!

Wait, teacher is best friends with his mother? That's why.

Fuck you Owen and your smug round face.School is like the book Lord of the Flies.  Take away the adults and it becomes just a hierarchy of children.  I'll tell ya somethi- Tell ya how I feel about school. It's a waste a time. Buncha people, runnin around, bumpin into each other. G-guy up front says "two plus two," th- people in the back say "four," then the- then the bell rings, and the give ya a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin, it- it's not a place for smart people. I hated teachers, not all but most. The 'because I say so attitude' over insane rules and dull lessons that sucked the life out of learning and made it all a memory game.

 So I became a teacher, I still despise teachers and how they enforce petty rules - even among themselves. The students have clocked on recently when I got a few of my tutor group out of an hour long detention for 'not putting drink in bag after many requests' and swearing (not at someone) - this is a school where we need police on site - chill the hell out, If a kid swears by accident just move on.  

I am strict but over the important stuff but teachers make it so difficult when they try and run it like a prison camp. I skip lessons I 'should' teach but that are so pointless they bore even me. I tell students honestly my opinion on some topics I have to teach and do not pretend that erosional landscapes are the most important things in the world. I have so much fun every day in class with the students because of it but give up a lot of my own time to keep lessons active. 

I teach really challenging students and am of the opinion that their home life is so shit I will not make it worse. I also have been given a bollocking from many staff for stupid things but I spent a long time battling teachers that I get by with management and never toe the line. So many teachers HATE kids its insane. I am well aware though that I will never progress professionally in this job because of this but I LOVE my time in classrooms when most teachers are praying for their own safety so would not trade this. A few of the worst things i have seen a teacher do:

1) Tell a kid he was disabled and she couldnt teach him (he was)
2) Call a parents known to be abusive to tell of poor behaviour (saying shit in class)
3) Not enroll a student in her english exam and tell her last week (exam in a month) this is illegal as we are funded to enrol every student
4) a completely fabricated story about a student ending up in suspension - CCTV proved this but school was too worried about the fallout to admit it. 
5) Tell a class that one student was gay (very rough school that had serious consequences). the kid had not come out yet, he was 13.
6) Give a student a detention BEFORE the lesson (we have an online system that logs everything) in anticipation of bad behaviour. The write up stated the student ' did little work, bothered and distracted others, showed little respect for authority and was rude'.Getting there at 7. Everyone wants to talk to you but all you want to do is get to your desk and sleep. Engineering the grading system to allow students who failed tests to pass by changing grading schemas.  It WAS 60% tests, 30% quizzes, 10% homework.  Got changed to 60% tests/quizzes, 40% homework.  Bullshit.  My grades went from 90 to 60 overnight even tho I had almost perfect testing scores.  Rotten ass school board and their progressive shit."Grab a partner" when you were in a class without any friends. Having to ride on the bus.

It was often late, no heat in winter and no air-conditioning in warm weather.Teachers that don't let the kids go to the bathroom Writing. Fucking. Papers.

If I can get my argument out in a clear and concise manner in two pages, why the hell would you want me to spend another five pages fucking around? 

It wasted your time, and it wasted my time. Grade my stuff based on its actual merit and not how much wood pulp I used up.How doing well in most classes meant that you were good at memorising the contentFeeling like everything was so important.In general, all the restrictions. You have bells, locked gates, can't use phones, can't listen to music, can't leave or come leave without permission or penalty, forced to go to "events". Reminds me of prison.The lunches are forever ruined because of Michelle Obama Teachers who use their platform to indoctrinate you on their political philosophy. The bullies and the counselors who didn't even help me on how to work towards my career path.That writing exhaustive essays and papers were the only way to demonstrate knowledge on any particular subject. Why couldn't I give a presentation? Why couldn't we have a lengthy class discussion about the same things? Why must I write a critical lens essay for every fucking chapter of "heart of darkness"????? How much gossip there was

I went to a small school with like 40 kids per a grade and anything you did went around the school. Fuck a girl? Yup everyone knows. Pee your pants? Everyone knows. Bust after 3 strokes? Everyone knows. So fucking annoying manGroup projects or speech/presentation infront of class, I'm super shy and I barely talk in class so its hard for me to do these kinds of things. And it's often a nightmare when I dont have any partners for group project so I often get assigned to a group by the teacher.Having D.A.R.E crammed down my throat so much.having to atend classes that you hated and would never use later in life......like goddam I hated art classes, I cant draw or paint for shit, I hate it and dont want to do it. Why do you force people to do it if they clearly dont like it and wont do later in life?? Its something that ''must be done'' solely because the School's bureaucracy requires it, but is utterly pointless waste of time. Another good example if this was literature class, where they forced you to read a book you couldn't give a fuck about, I dont like that book why should I read it. Having to ask permission to use the bathroom. Why is that even a thing?The authoritarian environment.Childlike drama. It started on day on in kindergarten and continues through elementary, middle, high school, college. And now even in competitive work place training courses. Drives me crazy.Existing. I would probably literally kill myself if someone told me I had to go through high school again.**H**omework
**O**bviously terrible
**M**akes me want to die
**E**veryday is stress
**W**ant to get it done
**O**pposed to sleep
**R**eally sucks
**K**inda pointlessAlso the fact that teachers get lazy during the beginning of the semester and don't give you any graded tests/homeworks/exercises, but then towards the end of the semester, they realized that they had no grades for the report card, so you as a poor, miserable student, had to study for tons of graded tests/exercises...etc. The worse thing is that they often piled up because of different subjects! Teachers that couldn't give a fuck, I was almost a straight A*(A+) student with the exception of English Literature, and after 1 year all my other grades are the same if not better and my German is a B. My entire class loathes the shit out of this teacher because we have genuinely regressed because of her.

tell parents about school and spend the rest of the day doing homework.How little help there was for me because I was "smart" I'm able to remember formulas and instructions easily but when it comes to putting it into practice I have a hard time. For example I know HOW to write an essay. I know what's required, I know the steps to take, I know what order things should go in. I still struggle with actually writing the essay though. Every time I asked for help or tried to explain what I needed help with I was told, you know how to do it, you're smart. Stop being so lazy. Being bullied.  I went to a shitty middle school where they basically just let it happen.The people.  Most of them hate me for no good reason except for having very different interests and stuff.  Heck, right now, I'm dealing with one guy at my school who is making my life hell.  King Douchebag has basically made me an outcast, to the point of him and all of his friends (and he has a lot, stereotypical popular dickbag) will walk away from me when they talk, and King Douchebag throws those little eraser caps at the back of my head a lot (those suckers hurt) all the time.  Ugh.  I can't wait for June.At the time it would have been not being in the "cool" kids clique. Although now everything turned out just fine except for not having studied enough.In my support techniques class at college my teacher docked my team points because we didn't have a troubleshooting guide in the 3 page user manual we had to create for Skype.  I joked with the rest of my team that next time we should turn in a binder full of paper that is our 'user manual with trouble shooting guide'

She is also the same one that told me when I asked why we were making floppy disks with a dos recovery image on them why. Then she responded with a snarky 'in case you come across a computer that doesn't have an operating system.'The feeling of being forced. When you think about it, school isn't that bad. But the simple fact that I felt I was forced to be there and do things made me hate it. That I was told I couldn't advance a year because "Oh we're worried about eleven_tentacles' ability to socialise with the other students."
So fuck them.Being told what to do. Hated it then, hate it now. (I'm self-employed.)Having to learn subjects that I will probably never use again in the real world. I get why we learn about history and stuff like that. But when will I ever use the quadratic formula or Avogadro's number? And when will I have to analyze Shakespeare? A lot of it just seemed so useless to me. I like college a lot more because I can choose what I want to learn for the most part."Good morning.  
In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. Mankind.

Perhaps its fate that today is the Fourth of July, and you will once again be fighting for our freedom Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution but from annihilation. We are fighting for our right to live. To exist.  
  
And should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day the world declared in one voice: We will not go quietly into the night!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*I was 15 years old when I overdosed on heroin. I was eating a bag of chips and was feeling real high and after that I blinked and suddenly I was on the floor with paramedics surroinding me. My friends had called 911 when they found me unresponsive and I wasn't breathing.

That was the last time I ever used heroin but sadly not the last time I indulged in opiates 

Right now I just drink and drink. Seems to replace the heroin pretty well IMO. I was lucky to not suffer withdrawals from heroin because I had only been using for a two month period at that time.I've overdosed on Alcohol 4 times. Each time was slightly worse than the last, each time waking up and seeing the drop ceiling tile of the ICU. Mostly, because I was underage there would invariably be charges attached along with my discharge. But the last time, (God willing) was different. My BAC was around .4 and I was actually legally dead for about 3 minutes. During that time, I had an out of body experience. I remember watching the ambulance pull up to the emergency entrance, and then unloading me into the hospital. It was pretty surreal, there was no temperature. Then I felt a strange breeze, and the next second I was seeing those familiar drop ceiling tiles again. 
After that, I stopped binge drinking. I'll still have a drink every now and then, but that scared the bejesus out of me.[removed]I overdosed exactly 91 days ago. I went to rehab, learned I was an idiot, and realized I'd die if I kept doing drugs. I don't use drugs as of this writing.OD'ed on Dilauded(hydromorphone). At first I just realized how shallow my breaths were, then I had the presence of mind to check my heart rate which was about 20 beats a minute. To tell the truth I was probably half a milligram away from complete cardiovascular arrest, having my heart simply slow to a stop. And I know this sounds stupid but in hindsight the biggest problem I had was the inability to urinate. I had to pee so so bad but even if I pushed super hard, like trying to pass a Buick sized kidney stone hard, I wouldn't even get a trickle. And then the vomiting began.

As far as how it changed me, I'm a lot more afraid of opiates now, and I've matured quite a bit over the last few years so I don't really do many drugs anymore, but really I can't say that that's because of the overdose instead of just growing up.

I still smoke weed, I don't drink, I don't pop pills unless, though I may take the occasional Hydro for pain that's once every few months at most. 

The thing about it is that I was just trying to get high, didn't really know what I had my hands on, I didn't really know the dosages, all I knew was that if I took a couple of those it felt real good, well one night I took a couple too many and that could really easily have been the end for me. I wasn't suicidal, or depressed, not upset, or even stupid, just made an uneducated choice, with something I really shouldn't have had in the first place. 

Parents: lock up, not hide, the pills.I ate a bottle of Tylenol when I was 14. I wanted to die badly. My mom and brother had just left for a NY trip. Woke up covered and surrounded by my own vomit. I was put on prozac. I will never be a "normal" human being again. Life comes atcha fast. *sighAdderall. I had a prescription that I honestly hardly needed, but the doctor was giving me 30mg 3x a day. A very large amount. The max dose. I'm a small sized girl, and I would barely eat or sleep while taking them. I would manically clean, study, workout etc and take one every time I'd start to crash. My body hated me for it, but I always felt like they were safe enough. My doctor really pushed them as being what I needed to succeed in school and that it was extremely safe.

It was 5am, the sun had started to just come up, and I was sitting in front of the computer finishing a project. I hadn't slept in about 2 days and had been popping the adderall like pez every 2-3 hours when my brain would start crashing. I took one, not even a thought about it. Maybe 10 minutes later it hit me, and oh it was bad. It felt like time slowed down, everything went still and I thought, "oh shit.". My ears were ringing, and I felt like I could barely walk. I got to the shower, and the edges of my vision started going black. I couldn't stand up anymore. My chest hurt so badly, intense pain with every racing heartbeat. I could barely move. I slowly crawled out of the tub, and into my room. I started going in and out. It felt like my heart was about to explode out of my chest. I couldn't move, and there was no one around. I passed out.

 I woke up hours later and my chest hurt, every breath and movement hurt. I was very weak, and it took a long time for me to get enough strength to crawl into bed. 

I was extremely weak, and had that uncomfortable dull chest pain for a solid week or so. It scared the shit out of me. 

Looking back I had probably taken about 3x my already way too high prescribed dose of 90mg a day. I stopped taking them. Adderall scared the shit out of me after that, and I spent months terrified I'd caused some permanent damage to my heart and testing for everything. For a long time I cut out every stimulant, and I've slowly started having some caffeine here or there. I'll never ever touch adderall again.In the early 2000s I went to a rave on a farm. I bought some ecstasy from a dealer and took it right away. About an hour and a half later nothing was happening. You can probably see where this is going. I went back to the guy to buy another and took it as well. About 10 minutes later I started to roll. It was great but I knew I was in for a bad time in about an hour. 

The night slowly became a blur. I was completely out of it, and almost brought down the sound system. Some random kids took care of me during the time. I remember coming to in the early morning hours while my friend was driving us home. Everything looked fake for about a week. 

I haven't touched the stuff since that experience. I'll still smoke weed occasionally or some other shorter term drugs once in a while. I had been a hardcore opiate junkie. I couldn't get any OC's one night; I flipped out on the girl I was staying with and she went and got me a bottle of methadone and some klonopin to calm me down.

I woke up three days later in the hospital completely clueless on why I was there. I assumed I was in a car wreck or something.

Due to oxygen deprivation to the brain, at least that's how it was explained to me. I had to "relearn" how to walk. I felt like I could walk but my legs wouldn't do what they were supposed to; instead of one taking a step, it would like twist in front of the other and I would fall flat on my back. Took 6 months to walk without a cane and over a year before I could run. I also for some reason couldn't hold a pen or pencil correctly and for all intents and purposes couldn't write.

Two days after I got out of the hospital I came down with Bell's palsy for the first and only time in my life. They said it was coincidental but I'm not so sure.

I lasted about a week before I went and scored again, but that was the end of the worst part of my addiction. Not long after I met who was to become my wife and aside from a few relapses, I've done OK.I OD'd on MXE by accident (who OD's on purpose I guess?). It thought it would form a cross tolerance with Ketamine which I had a high tolerance for-- so i was being sloppy with my dosing. 

I blacked out for hours, waking up every 10 to 45 mins or so. Each time I came to my wife was there checking on me, but she looked different... different versions of the same person. I came to understand that I had known her in previous lives and I was seeing incarnations of her I had known.

After about 5 hours of this... I tried to go to bed, but couldn't sleep because-- I had vivid closed and open eye hallucinations as well as audible hallucinations (that has never happened to me before or since). I floated through time and space, (figuratively)-- pastoral landscapes, abandoned cities, strange structures underground... just floated through them. All while hearing the most beautiful music I've ever heard in my life. It was like living in one of those old [Minds Eye videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdFfVx-LkN8) for a few hours. 

After about 30 hours I was able to sleep again, but nothing remarkable happened after the hallucinations.

As far as how it may have changed me-- My wife and I were having a lot of problems at that time. Seeing her different incarnations I had known helped me feel like we were on the right path (even if it was a hallucination).

I wouldn't recommend anyone OD on anything-- but this was one of the most unique experiences of my life.I used to abuse Promethazine w/ Codeine (Lean, Drank, Purple Drank, Sizzurp... Whatever the fuck you wanna call it) and overdosed twice. The first time I was just being stupid and didn't know that it stays in your system for a few days. I decided it would be fun to sip an oz one night, and progress each night. The first night I took one oz, the second I took two, and the third night I decided to pour four oz (you aren't supposed to have more than 4 oz in your system). I drank most of it, and said fuck it and tried to go to bed, as I was exhausted and truly fucked up. This was at about 10 PM. I woke up and hour later in sweats, shaking and instantly started vomiting. Within 10 minutes I knew what was happening. I got my father to take me to the ER and I honestly only remember vomiting, and then appearing in a hospital bed. I was there for a few days and got released two days later at about 6 PM. It's safe to say I was a little thrown off by the time, as I haven't been outside for two days. It felt like it was all within a few hours. It was weird. I stopped sipping for a while, and then fell back into a deep depression and stopped caring. The second time I overdosed I was attempting to commit suicide and just poured a shit ton into some fanta and started making music, waiting to overdose basically. I started shaking and sweating and vomiting again and passed out. I woke up the next day on my bathroom floor in nothing but my boxers. 

TL;DR Don't abuse cough syrup, or any downers for that matter.I was 19 and doing some coke with 2 friends at a hotel.  Anyways the night is wrapping up. We had just about finished up all the coke(8ball of some fish scale), when I decided that I want to listen to some music.   
A good buddy of mine had some awesome head phones. I put them in my ears and the next thing I remember there is 5 emts and firemen all around me.(the headphones definitely triggered it) I'm stuttering and confused as to what happened.     
Apparently in my confused state(right after the seizure before i had fully come too) I told them I decided to take 20 benadryl. (have absolutely no idea why; maybe I saw the unopened benadryl package in the kitchen.) 
  
Either way I'm argumentative and saying I didn't have a seizure I didn't know why they are here. Then the emt was like look at yourself man.   
  
I was soaking wet from sweating.  Like diving in a pool with clothes on and just climbing out wet.  At that point I was like okay maybe I don't know what happened. Maybe I did seize up. 
  
Then I heard my friend in the back talking to the fireman as they were bringing in the gurney to take me out. The second I heard his voice shaking and saw the look of concern on his face I knew I fucked up. 
  
  
There was one cop just hanging around the back looking around, waiting for his turn to do something,  while actively listening to our convo. (there was no coke left or any residue for that matter haha trust me I was the human vacuum that night)  
  
Anyways we are all sniffling like crazy and I declined the ambulance but the emts kept insisting that we were all doing coke and that I needed to go to the ER. I wouldn't admit to anything with the cop in the background.   
  
Eventually the lead emt/paramedic took our licenses and said if he didn't see us in the ER within 15mims after they left that he was going to have us arrested.  (idk the truth behind this but it worked) 
  
So we went to the ER got our licenses back. I got an ekg for 1.5hrs and a valium.  They told me I couldn't leave until my heart rate dropped to a certain number.   
  
Haha picture my two best friends practically having a panic attack after everything that happened, trying to calm me down so they could leave as well but still coked up af and trying to stay calm themselves.   
Long story short I will never do coke again and I got a $1900 ER bill.   

  
  
It changed a lot at the point in time it happened. I was a reality check I never knew I needed. I was independent of my parents living on my own, doing what ever the fuck I wanted. This curbed that. Now all I do is smoke weed and occasionally I'll drop some lsd or mdma.  But even that makes me nervous.   
  
What was really weird too. Is thinking back, I actually consciously remember the start of the seizure and the way my body felt. It was crazy, almost like my back became a wind up clock of sorts and just needed to "tick", like it was narural. But the second that "tick"  happened I don't remember a thing.  Luckily I had friends to hold my head and arms so I didn't injure myself more while flailing around. My friends actually had to keep the fold out couch I was on from folding itself in while I was seizing, while trying to keep me from injuring my self.   
  
I can say that I have truly amazing friends and that I traumatized them that night and I'm sorry. But it was a valuable lesson for all of us.   

tl;dr  I did too much coke too fast and had seizure. Argued with emts, declined ambulance and got ekg and valium, oh  and a $1900 bill. I've said this elsewhere on Reddit, but I overdosed on Ambien my first year of grad school.  I was stressed (duh, grad school) and became a bit of an insomniac.  The school therapist prescribed Ambien and I had been taking it for a bit without issue, but one night I took my usual dose and just didn't fall asleep.  So I took a second.  And that was the last thing I remember that night.  I've been told that I didn't fall asleep again and decided in my Ambien-addled brain to take the rest of the bottle.

My fiancee found me on the couch the next morning as pale as a ghost and rushed me to the hospital where they flushed it out of my system.   However, I was deemed a suicide risk and forced to spend a night in the psych ward... 

Where, to help me fall asleep, they gave me Ambien.

Anyway, that was eight years ago.  My fiancee and I married and have three kids, I ultimately dropped out of grad school (just last year) and have a kickass job in industry, so my life turned out pretty swell.About 7 years ago I had an overdose on ecstasy.  I was 18 at the time and it was the last day of spring break. 
I just wanted to have a good time that night. I took too many at one time and ended up in the hospital at 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. (Brain damage happens at 107.5, you die at 108)
I took the pills at 8:00pm and don't  remember anything from 10:00pm until 6 days later. I was in the hospital hallucinating for a while. They induced a coma and put ice blankets on me.
One month of serious recovery while i taught my legs to walk again. 6 months of PT until I could really hold myself up and get around without assistance. Then, one year later I hit the gym. Three years after that I am now a full time Yoga instructor. 
It was the biggest wake up call for me. I'm not happy the way it happened, but I'm so happy that it did happen. When I was in elementary I was on doctor prescribed anti depressant my first time taking them was a school day I remember just being extremely tired like the teacher kept waking me up every 5 or 10 minutes eventually she told me I should just go to the nurse if I was that tired cause the nurse had a quite room with a bed I could sleep there  next thing I recall waking up randomly in the back of an ambulance then a little while longer waking up with my mom and nurses around me at a hospital I don't remember all the details I do remember I was legally dead for 2 minutes and some where in there my vitals were 80 over 40 I was like 8 or 10 years old. The prescription had been miss read or miss written and the decimal was put in the wrong spot so my dosage was way to high. I also later in life fell in love with hydrocodone and had this happen again    also I'm not good at English spelling punctuation and anything else on here that's incorrect also not a doctor When I was 14, I overdosed on Valium and Alcohol. I don't remember anything really. Just that my friends came over and watched me, trying to make sure I didn't do anything stupid. Then I pissed all over a couch seat, and ran down my street almost completely naked. My friends had to chase me down and get me back inside. Then my parents come home...they have no idea what I did or anything but they do notice that something is off and then I just collapse. After that I just remember waking up in the hospital was an IV in my arm with an Doctor asking me if it was on purpose, or if I ever have thoughts of hurting myself or others. Now I just stick to weed. It didn't really change me in any huge way other then staying the hell away from pillsI overdosed on heroin in August of 2015. I went into rehab (for the second time) two days later, and swore I'd never get high again. Dove headfirst into the sober lifestyle, frequented AA and NA meetings, lived in a sober house. It lasted about a month and a half before I was put in a situation where my drug of choice literally fell into my lap and I was faced with a choice; back into the rabbit hole, or take what id learned and choose the higher road? 

I went back down the rabbit hole and struggled to keep up with my habit for another three months with a few close calls. Every close call brought me back to the feeling of waking up in an ambulance and realizing what had happened, and a slideshow of my family members and loved ones and their reactions to the news. Seeing my grandmother sob into her hands and hearing her go back and forth between yelling at me for being so stupid and thanking God I came back was the most heartbreaking experience.

Today I'm sober from heroin, I have a little bit of time under my belt. I've had the opportunity to use a few times in the last few months, but the memory of my overdose has definitely helped to keep me away from the needle. I would say it changed my life, but not in a epiphany type of way; more of a slow, gentle ascension into a higher understanding and appreciation for my mortality [removed]When I was 16 I took like 3 or so handfuls of Tylenol in a suicide attempt (yes i know it probably wouldn't have killed me, i was 16 and not thinking rationally) my friend figured out what i did and called my parents and the police.  My dad drove me to the hospital and thats when my stomach started hurting like never before.  They had to pump my stomach, which was something I'd never like to have happen ever again.  After that I felt much better physically, but there was a chance I could have really fucked up my kidneys.  Luckily, I was fine.  I stayed in the "adolescent mental health unit" (see: Loony Bin Jr) for 3 days and went home.  It wasn't so much the medical experiences that changed me, but more so how it affected people close to me.  My friends and my girlfriend cried when I came back to school, my mom couldn't even look at me, my brother cried. Unfortunately I still live with bipolar and a lot of other depression/anxiety shit, but I haven't made an attempt on my life since then, mostly just out of guilt.  I think if I didn't feel so badly about how people around me would feel, I'd probably be dead.throwaway because people i know are always on reddit. anyways, this has happened more than 3 times i can remember. tramadol seizures. its just like blacking out drinking. u just all of a sudden come to and ur body is all tingly and its so weird. u dont know if ur dieing or about to die or what. its the scariest time i ever felt in my life. nothing i can say can perfectly explaain every feeling or thought of thinking ur dead. its so fucken scary. then ur super sore for a few days. nothing to be joked about. i regret everything i ever had to do with tramadol. fucked upOn new years a couple years ago I threw a kegger with my brothers and a group of about 60-80 of our friends. I was playing beer pong the entire night and was constantly drinking. I downed half a bottle of champagne while we watched the countdown. I'm not quite sure what happened after that but I found myself in the bathtub throwing up a lot of alcohol and some red stuff which everyone believed to be blood. 


An ambulance was called and I was in and out of consciousness. I remember the paramedics coming to my bedroom and taking my blood pressure and such. Blacked out and wake up in the ambulance with my brother watching over me. I blacked out again and woke up in the hospital to a nurse sticking the IV in my arm. My whole family was at the hospital at a little after 1 am. I awake again and saw my dad crying for the first time. Above everything, that mental image stuck with me the most. 

I awake one more time almost completely sober because what ever was in the IV was helping flush the alcohol out of my system. The nurses told me later that I had a 0.4 blood alcohol level. They told me that the average person would go into a coma with that much alcohol in their system if they weren't already dead. 

My family stayed with me till about 8am when they knew that I was okay and was just waiting on blood work. Once I was alone the hospital sent in a counselor to see if I wanted to talk about quitting alcohol. I talked to her for a little while and told her that I didn't think I needed to quit alcohol but I did need to be more careful with it and enjoy it in moderation. 

After that I was sent to a different ward of the hospital and was now sitting in a chair rather than a bed. I was wearing nothing but the hospital gown they give you and had waited there for hours. They told me the first round of blood work would take a couple hours to see the results and then if they had any suspicions of anything that might be off that they would have to take them again. 

Turns out they had already taken blood while I was out cold and came to the conclusion that I would be fine and just needed time to continue flushing the alcohol out of my system. My brother just wanted to teach me a lesson about the dangers of alcohol and their consequences. He asked the nurses to keep me there for an extra 8 hours. So they kept telling me that they were constantly waiting on the blood work. The hospital legally couldn't hold me there against my will but they told me it was recommended that I wait for the results and being the cautious person I am, I stayed. I ended up staying in the hospital till 8pm before I called my brother to come pick me up. 

I had spent pretty well the whole first day of that year in a hospital and had plenty of time alone to think about my decisions. I realized that alcohol can be great but if I want to enjoy it, I have to be responsible with it. I still have a couple drinks once in a while.

For reference: I had drank a lot over the course of my life and started when I was only 13. This happened just after my 19th birthday and I am now almost 21. 

TL;DR: Drank way too much alcohol on new years and was in and out of consciousness. Went to the hospital where the alcohol was flushed out of my system. Helped me rethink how I use alcohol and now I enjoy it in moderation. Several times on mixed pressed Ecstasy and once on powdered MDMA. The final time it helped my stop cold turkey.

Still do it with alcohol, not excessively in the number of times I do it, just excessively drink when i do. I overdosed in 2011 on a drug called methoxetamine. It was legal at the time and was similar to ketamine but had stronger stimulant properties. The average dose was around 5 mg, so snorting a bump was good enough to fuck you up.

At the time I wanted to experience a k hole so I took nearly a gram of it and dumped it in some water and drank it. I figured it wouldn't be as strong orally and people generally don't die from ketamine overdoses since its used in high doses as an anesthetic.

I literally went out in like 5 minutes and the next thing I remember is a doctor pulling a breathing tube out of my throat in ICU. I was so confused at first that I thought I was still at my apartment. I kept trying to get up to go smoke a stoge but I was restrained and there was a bunch of medical equipment in my way, which confused me even more. Also, while I was out, I had been seizing and had bitten chunks out of my lips which hurt like hell and looked disgusting. Eventually my head cleared up and after about 3 days there, I went home.

It definitely fucked me up for a while. Id get simple songs stuck in my head all the time like Mary had a little lamb and it fucked up my fine motor skills a little. I still did drugs and wound up in hospitals and detox clinics a few times after, but fortunately got my shit together early 2014 and I've been completely sober ever since. I've overdosed twice on iv heroin Xanax and alcohol.   One time I would have died if I didn't get cpr.  A nurse heard my ex scream for help and ran inside and saved me.  I never got to meet the person who saved my life.  I got out of the hospital and got loaded, but have since found relative sobriety.  I still do other drugs, I just don't bang dopeI've overdosed on several pill cocktails. 

When I was younger I took a whole bottle of unisoms (I think they're just an antihistamine like benadryl.) It was weird. I kept forgetting what I was going to say as soon as I opened my mouth. Whoever I was staying with got on the phone with poison control and asked me to look for something and I ended up searching until the ambulance came way after that guy already found it because I kept immediately forgetting he told he had found whatever I was searching for. 

Ambien, I've had some episodes with. Days long periods where I'd just take a whole bottle and I've heard I've "literally lost my mind." I've been told I would talk to pictures, spoke only in gibberish and couldn't form real words. 

From the times I can vaguely remember where I only took 2-3 ambiens (I'm not sure what the miligram is, and I always black out after 4,) I remember seeing ghosts. Being convinced people were standing over my bed. I'd want to go do stuff, too. I always came back with twigs and empty cans and stuff I found on the road to take home and made really weird ugly crafts with them. I'd wake up to pinterest bulletins of a teepee or something and a bunch of twigs with a tarp in the corner of the room. 
 
Xanax and ambien is a horrible mixture. I did this several times a month for a few years. I don't remember anything that happened during this problem. Every few months I still take a few more than I should. I don't go THAT crazy, but I do completely forget the other night and was told I acted "off," the whole day I was on it.

Trazadone made me forget how to swallow my tongue, and vicodin made me throw up a lot and had a nice body high. Every pain killer was the same way, I can't remember what different ones I've tried. 

Yes, I still use drugs.I overdose 3 times. First two times i was sucidal. 3 time, i was just in so much pain.

1st time, i was on the phone with a self help. He was so nice. Than so alarmed, told me he called medics and he wanted to speak to my parents. I remember the way his voice changed. My stomach dropped. Emts came. They looked so annoyed. I remember feeling very hurt at that, and worried i was i. The way for them. I was, emtionally, a wreck. Getting strapped down, and a tube in my throat, all the way down to my stomach. It was horrible. And felt like forever.than they pumped in my stomach liquid characol. I couldn't look at black ink or black paint for months without being sick.i don't recall staying in hospital in the medical area. I was sent right away to the health unit though.

Second time i just had to drink liquid characol.

3rd time, i actually had to stay 2 nights.they gave me an antidote.  I took too many hydros and tyneol 4s. Pain meds just dont work on me. I can take fent or morphine or dilaudid and still be in lots of pain. So i lost track of how many pills i took that day. It was my birthday, i just wanted to be pain free and enjoy my day. Than i ended up in hospital and a week later my pain management dr dropped me.

I have a lot of guilt from my 3rd time. I feel like i dont deserve to be pain free anymore. Its hard to think back to that day. It really broke my heart.I've OD'd a few times. The worst was when I was in a coma for 5 days. Apparently I had almost every single drug in my system except crack. When I woke up they asked me if I wanted to know the results and I proudly said yes I did all while my parents were in the room. Not fun. I went straight to rehab after. The ~overdosing~ part wasn't bad. That would be an okay way for me to die in my opinion. Waking up was hell. I was hallucinating & had a breathing tube down my throat. Every time I would wake up I would try to pull it out (but they couldn't take it out so they strapped my arms down which was even worse. I kept waking up. Then pass out a few seconds later & stop breathing) It was awful not to even go into the catheter. I went crazy on my mother too but I don't remember any of that. 10/10 wouldn't recommend. I'm so lucky I don't have lasting damage. Everyone thought i would & made my parents come fly across the country to say good-bye to me. 

My 2nd shitty OD was on alcohol & benzos when I was 16. The last thing I remember was talking on the phone to my friend having a great fucking time. My friend said I told her brb going to the bathroom. I never came out lol. I woke up in the hospital to everyone asking why I tried to kill myself. I was so confused because I DIDN'T try to kill myself. Apparently though when I went to the bathroom I filled the tub with water & put a bunch of things in it (stereo, hair straightener, ect. all plugged in) They found me passed out next to the tub. I don't remember doing ANY of that, that's the freakiest part. So I had too much money at the age of 19 and bought a vile of LSD, it turned out to be a research chemical though. I was in and out of consciousness and later my friends told me I was having seizures all night. After that I quite all drugs besides weed. I had a crazy three months of drug binging and have no need to ever be out of mind again.About two months ago, I shot about .15 of some grey powder heroin (Midwest drugs yaaay) while I was already suuuuper high. I mean I could barely hit myself high. Like could hardly open my eyes high. I woke up standing in my buddy's living room in my underwear (he and my gf threw me in the shower to splash me with cold water) and I was high. As. Fuuuuck. After that I kept using every day(why wouldn't I?) until 4 days ago when I changed my number, deleted my Facebook, and am trying to hit the straight and narrow. Wish me luck fam; it's fffffdfucking hard!The multiple times that I OD'ed never changed my pattern of behavior. To be fair, I've never had much of a concern for my own well being. 

The time my roommate OD'ed on the otherhand changed a lot. 

Let me set the stage: We had just recently ordered 5 grams of MDMA from the Netherlands (which was awesome).  Everything went through just fine. So one of my roommates decided to order a little something else. He decided that India would have close to enough of the same product quality controls as the Netherlands. 

So my roommate ordered a grab bag of Indian benzos. When they arrived, they were obviously made in a back room with a pill press. That never discouraged him. So he took a bunch. They didn't do anything (surprise, surprise), so he took the rest of them all at once. These did do something. They landed him in on a respirator for the next two days. 

After that, the other roommate decided the whole situation was too much and tried to dissolve our lease. Eventually we decided if we all got sober, we could keep living there for a while longer. Oddly enough we all managed to stay sober, but then we got kicked out about a month later anyways. 

And... I've just never really fallen back into it. I've always got some shit to do or something that prevents me from getting back into it that far. 

But those few days afterwards sucked. Like, sleep in a bathtub because I can't stop retching kind of suck.

Anyways, there's not really a point to this comment anymore, or if there is I forgot it already, but I figured I should post it anyways. Seems like waste of effort if I don't. No idea. I was around the age of 1 and somehow managed to climb onto the counter, open the medicine cabinet, tear open the plastic bottle with my baby teeth and swallowed most of my brothers sleeping pills.I've overdosed a couple times. The first was a month before I turned 18. I had been up all night shooting up cocaine with my nasty 48 year old drug dealer. He made a really large shot, shot me up, and I instantly knew something was wrong. My vision went dark from the outside in, and the rush of the drugs felt the same way on my body. Like everything was folding inwards from the outside. I was told that I had a seizure, but I don't remember that. When I came to, I guess I didn't realize who or where I was for awhile. I was afraid of my drug dealer because I didn't recognize him. I was on the edge of a bed kicking at him to stay away from me. I finally got ahold of my senses and stopped, and said "why am I kicking you? What happened?" and that's when he told me I had a seizure.

The after effects of that have been really bad. My brain has never quite been the same, I used to be the kid who got straight A's without having to try, concepts just came naturally to me. Now I can't focus well, I just feel stupider in general to be honest. Takes me a lot longer to "get" something, and my memory is terrible, I'm always forgetting everything. Now this could be due to several years of drug abuse, but I noticed it happening directly after this event. Another thing that happened is one of my pupils was huge and the other tiny, that lasted a couple days and one of my pupils is stlll slightly larger then the other, but you have to really look close to notice.

The other time worth mentioning, I was trying to detox from my heroin addiction and my mom drove me an hour out of town to get some oxy 80mg's. I don't know why we thought this would help. On the drive back, I decided to take them, these were the newer formula that's hard to crush up and abuse, so I decided to swallow them. Being this big bad dope addict I thought I could handle two of them- 160mg. But, I had already been in withdrawal for almost a week and my tolerance was down a bit. A little while after taking them, my ears started feeling weird, like I couldn't hear properly and they needed to pop. I felt a rush and again, like everything was folding inwards and I fell out. I don't know how long I was out but my mom said my eyes rolled in the back of my head and everything- she thought I was dead and that she had killed me. I started hearing my name very sofly, "Caiden92....Caiden92...." and it got louder and louder "CAIDEN92....CAIDEN92!....CAIDEN92!!!!" and finally it was loud enough to wake me up. I opened my eyes and looked at my mom who was sobbing and asked what happened. Then spent the entire drive home convincing her I was okay. 

My mom stopped drinking that night trying to support me in getting sober. I was 19 at the time, and the very next day my best friend in the world died from a heroin overdose. I'd love to say I got clean after that but it took me until age 21. I'm 23 now and have been clean from everything for over 2 years. 

TL,DR: overdosed on both cocaine and oxy at seperate times, now clean and sober!Don't have much memory of the experience. I had been drinking and taking a combination of Benzos/opiates. Apparently I fell over and was convulsing for a few minutes. Got up and went back to drinking beer for a while. It didn't really hit me til after. I still drink and occasionally take pills, but I'm not so big on trying to get as fucked up as humanly possible anymore.I accidentally snorted ~0.5 of (pure, good quality) MDMA all at once, as a rather small person with little tolerance. I thought I was dying for a little while, and even imagined sirens everywhere. It was really scary cause though I was with my boyfriend, I realised that none of the people I was with (including him) were gonna call for help if anything started to go seriously wrong. 


About 15 minutes later, after chewing a hole through my boyfriend's sweater, I began to have a really nice strong roll. Unfortunately, I wasn't loving the people I was with and the whole thing was probably only fun cause of the molly.


The next day, I felt horrible. I fell into a deep depression that lasted 3 months. Everything felt empty. I became paranoid all the time. It was horrible. I lost all my friends, and my boyfriend (probably for the best though). 


The experience as a whole didn't make me quit doing drugs, though I now am much more careful about dosage and not just doing random amounts of random white powders. I also make sure to do molly only once every 3 months. I also have a "no snorting" policy for drugs now, and only do drugs with people who I know would be useful if something horrible happened. I realise this wasn't a super-overdose story, but it really fucked with me. Be careful out there!I overdosed on Heroin and Xanax about 3 months ago. At first it scared me to death and I didn't want to have anything to do with drugs... for three weeks. I've been in an outpatient rehab programs ever since I overdosed but I've relapsed 3 times and last weekend I had a pretty devastating relapse on heroin where I drained my savings and now my dad is kicking me out today.Took ecstasy at the club Exits in NYC.  Realized I was nodding off a little and the next thing I knew I was listening to the beeps of the machines monitoring my vitals in the hospital.  No idea how I got there.  Pulled the sensors off my body, went back to the club, spent $30 to get back in at 6am and found my friends still dancing all fucked up.  This was circa 2000 and I'd have no idea how to get my hands on hard drugs anymore.  Still drink and occasionally smoke weed.  Good times.I didn't OD, but this is what made me realize drugs can make you feel terrible just as easily as they make you feel good.

I was at a music festival about a year back and I went into an extreme state of paranoia because of e. It started off by noticing a few undercover cops trailing my group before I took my dose. They aren't hard to notice because they're always middle aged men that don't look like they're enjoying themselves and just look out of place.

Anyways after the e kicked in I started to get super paranoid to the point I felt like there was always an undercover behind me. Because of this I totally freaked out when I saw my friends taking their pills out in the open. So this lead me to believe that we were all totally getting arrested.

In my fucked up mental state I came to the conclusion that some of my friends did indeed get arrested and the cops were manipulating them to make the rest of us confess to illegal activities. 

Everything I witnessed that night ended up being blown out of proportion in my brain.

When someone would ask if I was rolling, I'd think they were wired with a mic so I'd just keep quiet. When I was offered a drink, I thought they were trying to get my saliva for drug testing. They were handing out free glowing wristbands, I thought those were bands used by the police to identify people they were manipulating to catch others. So I was freaked out when a large portion of my friends were wearing them.

Anyways since I thought all my friends were compromised I did not want to go back to our rental house with them. I ended up walking around the city for THREE HOURS. My best friend refused to leave me and followed me the whole way.

This only added to my paranoia because I thought he was working with the police. I ended up having to get creative to ditch him so I walked into a gym where he couldn't follow me because I had a membership and he didn't. 

I ended up waiting at the gym for a friend in the area that also attended the same festival. She picked me up and had a friend in her car. I thought the friend in her car was also an undercover because she was on her phone talking to her "boyfriend" the whole time. I thought that was just a clever way for the police to listen in on whatever I was saying in the car.

So I spend the night at their hotel. Leave in the morning before any one wakes up. Taxi out to the bus station and took a 7 hour bus ride home. 

Drug are bad kids.I once snorted 8 Ritalin, took 10 hydros and 2 Oxys, and smoked about a quarter of weed all in one night. How I didn't die, I'm still not sure but I came damn close. That changed me a lot, and I was in a bad place in life to begin with.
Another time I took half a hit of acid and crushed up adderall and mixed it in a blunt. Come to find out mixing addy and LSD intensifies your trip by a shit ton....
The trip itself was actually fine, albeit much stronger than a normal one. But the comedown fucked me up for weeks. Back to back panic attacks while on acid are terrible for your mind. I sat in my room for several days just crying after that. 
Don't ever mix drugs without knowing what they do. Please.Had too much G once, it was so fucked up. I was laying down on the floor and I couldn't talk. I was gasping because every time I tried to talk it would not come out. I was lapsing in and out of being awake. My friends had to hold my hand and make me squeeze their hand after they asked me a question since I couldn't talk. Ambulance came to the house but I was actually getting better. My friends stripped me down and had to put me in a shower to wake me up. I truly think that if I had just a little more I would be dead today.  OD'd on a dilaudid, fentanyl, diazapam cocktail.  My cousin found me blue and not breathing,  ambulance guys gave me a shot of narcon. Felt just like the scene in trainspotting when he rises up 6 feet. Had two grand Mal seizures in rehab. I no longer mess with opiates and barbiturates.This was a minor overdose, but it certainly changed things.

I was heavy into opiates and stealing them from my mother at the time. I needed help and was in an extremely dysfunctional relationship as well. I had been taking her Neurontin because it made me disassociate and hallucinate. I remember the night it happened, I think I was somewhere between 3000 to 4000mgs. I could barely keep my head up and had to keep drawing in sharp breaths to breathe again. 

The next morning, I was completely awake and realized that I had probably gone way too far. That evening, I ended up in the ER as I had given myself two kidney stones from all the drugs.

I don't dare touch heavy meds like those anymore. I still drink and smoke weed, but I know my limits and it's far and few between as getting older makes the hangovers a bitch. The years of painkiller abuse has taken its toll on me and I know that my kidneys are fairly damaged. I now can't even get dehydrated without them making some fuss, which is a bit of a blessing.

I'm in a much better place and facing my stresses head on. I'm out of the dysfunctional relationship and in a really amazing and loving one with someone who also was able to overcome their addictions and troubles. It means a lot and brings a deep support into it.I am not a drug user but I work at a place where people overdose all the time, usually heroin, and from my perspective it doesn't change 90 percent of people. 

It has changed me, watching people die, finding dead bodies, hearing kids crying because their parent isn't waking up. I used to cry and have nightmares all the time, now Im super desensitized and kind of just annoyed by it.Throwaway cuz of Reddit friends, but here's my story:
My sophomore year of college was my "I'm gonna try every drug I've always wanted to try" year. So up until this night I had experimented with mushrooms, acid, coke, pain killers, you name it. We were having a party at my apartment and one of my friends brought his buddy from his hometown to the party. I should have known this dude was no good just from his looks and his demeanor but hindsight is 20/20. We are partying, drinking, having a great time when we decide to go into a bedroom and smoke some weed. Friend's shady hometown buddy mentions he has some ecstasy he is selling so naturally I'm like "hell yes. I haven't tried E yet. heard it's cool, count me in!" 

I buy one pill off of him for $10 and prepare myself for an even better night. I swallow it down with a beer and smoke some pot and try to get in the right mindset to roll my balls off. About 45 mins to an hour go by and I don't feel anything. Did I get scammed? Did I not wait long enough? Who really knows so I buy one more from him and eat it immediately. No more than 10 minutes later I stand up to take a piss and it feels like gravity was turned up to 11. Like I was walking on the bottom of the ocean. "OH FUCK."

I make it to the bathroom and projectile vomit into the toilet. I know people use the term "projectile vomit" all willy nilly a lot, but this stream of puke literally shot out of my body. I then collapsed to the floor and can barely stand, again, due to the feeling of intense gravity. My roommate must have heard the commotion because he burst into the bathroom to see if I was ok. The look on his face immediately conveyed to me, just how badly off I was. His concern freaked me out so badly, I will never forget that. Now as some background, 2 of his 5 brothers were heroin addicts. He has seen dope overdoses numerous times, and he said I looked just like them when they OD'd. He asked what color the pills were...orangish-brown. After doing some quick research he concluded that I most likely ate compressed heroin, and not ecstasy like I thought.

I got into a cold shower and just laid there with the water washing over me hoping to cool my body temp down. (Probably stupid in hindsight but I've watched Bad Boys 2 many times so I thought it would help). After the shower he got me a gallon of water and I just went to town on it as best I could. I was laying on his bedroom floor just nodding in and out of consciousness. It's so crazy to look back on it because I have seen heroin addicts who "nod off" in the middle of conversation when they are super fucked up. I didn't even realize that was what was happening to me. I would be telling him I'm ok and that....sleep. No really man I'm....sleep. Ok maybe you should call....out cold. After about an hour and a half of this I could finally stay awake for more than 5 minutes and could talk clearly to him. Later on he told me that the entire time he had 9-1 dialed into his phone just waiting to punch that last 1 in and get an ambulance there. 

I guess I flushed out my system with all the water. Maybe my body is stronger than I thought, not really sure. The rest of the night and the next morning I felt so calm and relaxed, as if I was in a dream. Super scary situation which changed how I experimented with drugs forever. After that I always measured out my doses of drugs that I KNEW were what I thought they were. I know it's probably not as crazy as some of these other stories but that was my experienceMy roommate overdosed and I heard a weird noise from his room, found him choaking on vomit and not breathing and blue. I first heard the sound of wheezing as I walked to my room from bed and stood in the hallway for a moment debating to go check out if it was fine. Eventually I called his name from the hallway, "hey, shut up or I won't be able to sleep..." I just wanted to check he was okay. No answer. I went in and found him, called 911 immediately, his jaw was locked shut so I pried it open and jammed my fingers in to dig out the vomit, bent him over the side of the bed, occasionally he would take two or three breaths like he just came from underwater, then stop breathing again. He bit into my fingers deep, there was blood and vomit and panic everywhere. My mind was slow and analytic, but fast and terrified. Very strange feeling. I gave him vomit CPR and kept trying to get him breathing until the EMTs arrived. 

It changed me. It's hard to say how, but I'm a much more careful person now. What if I had just decided to go to bed instead of check on him? I always have to make the right choice when it counts now, what if I had chosen wrongly? It's haunting. I wanted to die. I was in graduate school and my anxiety was keeping me from being able to do any work at all. I was failing. 

I took a bunch of the Ativan (Lorazepam) prescribed to me mixed with alcohol, and got into a bathtub full of water.

I only remember waking up by throwing up lots of water, and I dragged myself out of the bathroom to bed, where I slept for about 36 hours.

I only told my therapist and psychiatrist - no one else. They recommended inpatient or at the minimum intensive outpatient care. I did neither, but did drop out of school. 

Year later and I'm better, but the darkness still gets to me. I never did finish school - I've been back and had to drop out again. I feel it tugging at the side of my consciousness sometimes. 

I will never take Ativan or any benzo again, because I'm scared of what I'd do if I got too upset. I don't want to ever risk it.I've ODed a few times on heroin. I'm going to go shoot up now. There's a lot more I could say, let me know if you want to hear more about my miserable life.I once had seven coffees in around six hours, was manic, sweating, paranoid and  thought I was going to go crazy.  
Still drink caffeine today even though I know how dangerous it is.I remember taking the first 2mg bar of xanax. I dont remember taking the next 10 bars. Luckily I wasnt dumb enough to take any other drugs at the same time (or maybe I was just too fucked up, I dont remember.) The three days after are completely gone from my memory.  I don't use xanax anymore.    I have a history of heroin addiction and poly-substance abuse (cocaine/crack, meth, benzos, etc.)  Like multiple years.  I have also spent time as a homeless addict.  I know plenty of people that have ODed I know very few where that has made them quit.  Most opiod addicts if they get Narcaned (as in Naloxone) just want to do more dope so that they get high again and stop being sick from the Narcan. I've even heard people ask not to be Narcaned if they fall out (OD) just to let them die, so they don't lose their high.Not drugs, on 100% cranberry juice.  I am pretty damn serious. 3 weeks ago, we bought 100% cranberry juice,  i mixed it with vodka and had about 3 tall glasses of the mix. Turns out you can overdose on cranberry juice.  I'm used to 25%, not 100%. Just a PSA....

I dont drink 100% anymore, and i try to research most of what i drink now. Well let's say it like this. You really shouldn't try to OD.

Not using drugs anymore but that's for a different reasons as OD really don't change anything. If you're down/depressed/stupid enough to start using drugs (cocaine, heroin, meth etc) you more than likely don't care if you live or not. Personally I woke up in a hospital and just walked out of there within the next 5 minutes because I really didn't understand why anyone bothered to take me there. Didn't change anything and the next day I was back at it. 

Today I'm clean and have been so for a while but it had nothing to do with the OD part. Perhaps if you're pressured into doing drugs I can understand that surviving an OD would cause you to be more careful in the future and really stay away from it.Back in high school, I worked the midway at Six Flags over Texas. 

Nothing's rigged - people are just dumb enough to believe they can land quarters inside little red circles on a table, or that spending a dollar to try and win a dish that you could buy at Job Lots for 50 cents is a good idea. There was a 20/20 or Dateline episode about this. Some are absolutely rigged. Basketball hoops are too small or basketballs are overinflated so they bounce all over. Milk bottles can be glued in a stack or have magnets in them. Fuck it. I'm gonna find the episode on YouTube. Brb.

Part 2: https://youtu.be/mJqCz2ql9OE
My family owned a few rides and a handful of games when I was a kid and we traveled with bigger shows. I can't speak for all games or shows, but I was an observant kid. I worked a lot of the games when I was old enough. This is some of what I saw in the 80s/90s:

The "One-ball," a game where you throw softballs at 3 old fashioned milk jugs stacked in a pyramid, seems simple enough. In reality, the top bottle is empty, but the bottom two are solid and they are made of concrete. They weigh a ton. 

The basketball hoops are either bent at an angle that is difficult to see from the shooter's perspective, they are much smaller than regulation, or the balls are over-inflated. (Maybe all three.) 

The "throw a dart, win a poster," game is pretty straightforward, but you're spending $1 a dart and we paid 5 per poster.

The ball/basket toss only works reliably if there's already a ball in the basket.

The ring toss where the items sit on pedestals and you win whatever the rings goes completely around: the pedestals are short and cubic for a reason. Even if the rings goes around the item, 95% of the time it will bounce back up and catch on a corner.

Cork-gun & cup, balloon darts, pick-a-lucky whatever games where the prize is revealed after you do something: many times there are NO large prizes on the board. It's always at least 90% small, which is REALLY small. 

Coin dozer games: often slightly inclined to the sides, so coins that fall are far more likely to drop to the side than into your pile. 

Spin-the-wheel type games: almost always weighted. They are not rigged!It's really difficult to set things up properly with such small hands.  Fortunately we have our filling cabbage soup to sustain us in our labors. I'm not a carnie, just an attendee, I gotta say the best prize I ever won was an iguana. I refuse to play games again until I see an iguana as a prize.Nizo wizone spizeaks cizarnie izany mizore.As said before, they are not rigged, for every one I'm familiar with.

It really is mostly skilled based, the only rigging that happens is making it as hard as possible for someone to be successful.  Even then, the cost of the stuffed animals are usually pretty proportional to the tickets you spend, even if you perform perfectly.  (They are cheap stuffed animals).

(I'm not a carnie - I used to spend a lot of my summer time at the fair a good friend worked as a carnie at, during my college years).I would like to recommend Dan Fante's autobiography. Fante was John Fante's son and in his extremely varied existence, he worked as a carny at Pacific Ocean Park (long gone but a Twilight Zone with Jack Klugman was filmed there in the early 1960s) and he goes into some detail about this.Austin Powers. Any of them. The subtlety in the writing and acting in that movie is incredible. The whole movie is hilarious on both the shallow and deeper level. The LOTR and Hobbit trilogies after reading the books and especially the Silmarillion. You notice more subtle references and understand why certain things are such a big deal. Like the fight between Gandalf and the Bolrag. Was it a big fight that was awesome with no context, duh... but understanding the significance of the enemy and the true power those two really have just made the fight during the movie that more impressive.   Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. Or most movies involving Edgar Wright's direction. Lots of little jokes meant to keep re-watches enjoyable.Office SpaceThe Life Aquatic and Grand Budapest Hotel both are Wes Anderson films with not only great stories, but amazing aesthetics. The Big LebowskiThe Cornetto Trilogy: Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and the one I didn't get into very much with aliens.The Departed

*POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERTS*

After watching it for the first time, I read on IMDB, that anytime Scorcese filmed a character in front of an 'X', that meant that character was going to be dead by the end of the film. Right after I read this, I immediately watched it again and picked out all the X's in the background of the character.Fight Club! Fincher leaves so many subtle details troughout the movie that hints the plot twist.

or MementoThe twelve monkies.the prestige Hot fuzzYeah, I'm going to go with a show here because it was the first thing that came to mind. Breaking bad is really fun to watch the second time, if only to analyze Walter's behavior from the beginning. I think like most people on the first run through, you view Walter as a man slowly corrupted over time. An individual who becomes manipulative. However, on the second watch, I believe he was that way all along, just dormant. Could just be me though. Bone Tomahawk

I picked up on more of the witty dialogue the second time around Miller's Crossing.  The whole movie is the little things.

The entire movie takes place in an alternate universe, and he's being guided throughout the entire thing *just* to do what he does near the end, all to unknowingly help his past self. It's nuts when you actually sit back and look at it. Zootopia

 Naturally, with so much talent packing the cast, there's a massive amount of little character quirks they each add to the film as a whole. Really neat to catch on to another little thing every time (Donald Pleasence in particular is brilliant with the smallest edge of a scene).

It can be a lot more technical than most people realize. There is a boat and all related electronics and accessories. Then there are rods and reels which you will need for different situations (it's like golf clubs). Then there are lures and terminal tackle which will be constantly bought. Not to mention licenses and fuel that you always need. I personally like high quality equipment which does matter at higher levels. 

I also ice fish which is another nightmare. Augers, heaters, shelters and electronics are basically mandatory.

Shit doesn't come cheapLiving in San Francisco. woodworking and landscaping my house. i cant walk in to lowes or home depot without spending 200$Golf. Irons, bag, wedges, woods and putter can all reach 2-3 grand for the newest clubs. Then if you want to get good you should, but don't have to, pay a professional to teach you. $35-$75 per lesson. Then every round of golf you want to play. $28-$75 per round around me. 12 balls $10-$40 only to lose them through a couple rounds. The higher the price the better the ball. Gloves $10-$20 which will be worn out within the season depending on how much you play. Photography and motorcycles Traveling. Those plane tickets add up. Oh god, where to start... skiing is pretty expensive especially since I don't live near a good snow mountain, so once you factor in travel costs I can really only afford to go every now and then.

Climbing wasn't too bad when it was just indoors (harness, shoes, chalk bag, carabiner/belay device), but now I'm starting to look into outdoor climbing and that involves buying ropes and quickdraws and more gear in general.

Knitting started out reasonably inexpensively but quickly added up (it takes so long to knit anything that you really want to have something nice at the end for your trouble, so you have to use nice yarn).Cooking. The day I spent $80 to make a Wellington dinner, I drank the wine and cried myself to sleep.That would be cocaine.Hobby/activity/sport was paintball.

And constantly paying for  sock tape, stick tape and wax, skate sharpenings, and  pucks.
 
Now you're ready to play. ~$10 a stick n puck time , or pick up game... But if you want to learn it $5-10 to just learn how to skate each time... Want to be on a team? Buy another set of jerseys and socks, and $20 a game. . it's not like basketball or soccer where you need a court / field and ball and shoes.

*Master Racing Intensifies*Shopping - I'm trying to change that

And painting is expensive in oilI collect rocks/minerals. I guess I realized when I started paying easily 100$ for some pieces that I have an expensive hobby. PokerClimbing (Rock/ice/alpine) and Astrophotography.   
Also, Legos.  My boyfriend and I like collecting instruments, even ones we don't play in hopes that one day we'll learn them. For the ones we do play, there are so many different types! For example, I play an obscure(ish) instrument, the harp. A basic harp is ~$1,000 but if you want a good one it is likely $3,000-$5,000. That's just for a lever harp! Pedal harps cost $20,000+ So if you're just starting out and want to test the waters, it's already an investment for the beginner-level instrument.

And then you have double strung harps, triple strung, cross strung, travel harps (smaller harps, carbon fiber harps that have greater range and weigh like 5lbs, etc), wire strung harps (but bronze or steel or what? They all have different sounds), gut strung harps, lap harps (within these you have the same choices of single or double or triple strung etc), harps with different types and amounts of levers, harps made with different materials for different resonance, harps with different shapes (usually gothic versus Celtic), electric harps (!!), and then you get into ethnic "harps" like the Japanese Koto or Chinese Guzheng and that opens up a completely different door.

Bet you didn't know there's so much to know about harps!Saltwater aquarium. There is always somethings to add or upgrade or semi-needlessly change. Of course the water animals too.Astronomy, I have two telescopes that have cost almost $2,000, I have a mount that has cost me almost $1,500. My camera cost me like $1,000, my eye pieces have cost me almost the same. Then the star charts and iPad app and club fees are a few $100. All together it has been a really expensive hobby, but its amazing. trap shooting, or any shooting sport.Collecting watches.

Less than 5k for a watch? Affordable, pseduo luxury. 10k for a single watch? Completely normal. 30k? Better not tell the wife.

The hobby seriously skews your perception of money.Sneakers. Re-sellers are the WORST.Watching cable TVHockey, snow machining, video games and aviation.Collecting fountain pens and inks, already have spent $200+ on 4 pens, and $40+ on inks I knit and crochet. It's a hobby that seems like it'd be cheap to most people, since everyone's seen those $3 skeins of Red Heart acrylic yarn at Hobby Lobby/Michael's/JoAnn's.

Except that cheap yarn like that is almost universally garbage (I'm not a super yarn snob, I think acrylics have their uses), and that decent yarns made from natural materials can *easily* top $20/skein. And the yardages tend to be smaller. And then you fall down the rabbit hole of hand-dyed homespuns and dear lord you can drop a small fortune in an instant.

Tip: if someone knits or crochets you a gift, they not only put a lot of time and effort into it, but depending on what it is, possibly spent $100+ on the supplies. Be fucking appreciative.

My favorite cheap yarn is Lion Brand Wool-Ease, it's a wool-acrylic blend that doesn't feel plasticy, comes in a ton of colors, and rarely runs more than $5/skein. For nicer yarns I'm a fan of Malabrigo in particular because of the gorgeous colors. I can't afford the really nice stuff though I'd love to play with silk yarns someday.restoring/modding a classic corvette.  shit adds up fast, and spending can easily run out of control Paintball I used to play Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40k.  The first 3-4 years was okay, but then Games Workshop, the company that makes Warhammer, started jacking up their prices 2-3 times a year while losing quality pretty consistently.  I quit and sold all my armies.  Luckily I was a good enough painter where I ultimately more than tripled my money, but still.Buying recordsMusic. High end guitars cost over $1,000 most of the time, same with high end drums.Machining. Milling machine + cutters and attachments + shipping = $3500. Lathe + toolbits and attachments + shipping = $6000. Sad part is I've only used the machines about 10 timesFor me it's model rockets. The rockets aren't too expensive (I mostly get Estes) but the engines are a bit expensive for single use, especially the large ones. 

I thought about collecting swords until I saw the prices for real ones. Now I just look for cheap display quality ones.Firearms.  God damn.Hiking and backpacking. I spent about a grand on my gear, although I could do some upgrading such as a smaller and lighter pack and a shelter made out of the same stuff they make racing sails out of (these shelters cost about $600).

But the real cost is gas. I live in the Bay Area and all the good stuff is pretty far away. I'm 350 miles from Bishop so I can burn through over a tank of gas for a weekend. Not cheap plus it's a lot of miles to put on a car. Weekend warrioring gets pricey, especially if you can't get people to join in. Plus, you gotta buy glamping gear for when you're car camping...

Then you have thru hiking. I spent a little less than $5000 (including gear upgrades) for 5.5 months of hiking. And I'm going to do the same damn thing again on the CDT sometime. Lots of opportunity cost- that's a year that I won't be working.Let's see, woodworking, skiing, amateur radio, or flyfishing. Its a tough to say. I have saved the most with woodworking by building a new kitchen. To replace my shop would probably be close to $30,000. Add lumber and supplies for projects that never end. I get to ski here and there in the winter (got 12 days this year). Fucking FRAGRANCES. I've been into perfumes/colognes for several years now and I'm still furious about getting roped into this shit so bad. IT'S A SMELL. Smell hobby. Ridiculous.

...Thankfully, I tend to subsist on the free samples I can get from counters, and the booming trade/barter system of the online perfume community, too. Reefkeeping. I constantly look at coral and think "Hey! That's not so bad!" and buy it. I don't even want to add up how much i've spent on equipment and water changes.It was just weed (stacking to about 500pcm) 

But games are adding to the pain. 

I don't eat much any moreScuba diving. I own all my own gear, which was a massive outlay, and I go out on one of the local dive boats twice a month ($145 - $215 each trip). Although my freediving is catching up now that I have a coach and am seriously contemplating dropping $600+ on a monofin.Fish aquariumsAviation. One flight typically costs me ~$200 and that's on the cheap side. Combine that with landing fees, service subscriptions, medical exams, and god forbid aircraft damage (you NEVER want to pay for a damaged aircraft), and you've got yourself a bank account drainer.

Oh, and a license costs upwards of $10,000.GamingCollecting figurines. Just dropped a pretty penny on a long out of production Misa Amane figure.My latest hobby, drone flying, has turned into a surprising money sink. 

Right out of the gate, buying spare propellors for the $60 micro quad I purchased began burning a hole in my wallet, then other spare parts and batteries made that hole bigger. The second toy quad introduced me to FPV (live video from the quad that I could in theory fly by), which was like a drug that I needed more of. Once I got good enough at not crashing, I began researching my first build, which took a few hundred dollars for the parts, then a few hundred more for the radio and FPV monitor, and on top of that I needed batteries and more spare props... This is forgetting all the tools I had to buy to actually build the thing, which cost a surprising amount. 

I certainly wouldn't hesitate to say that I've spent at least a grand or so on ultimately building my flying blender, and it hasn't stopped there. A single battery for a race quad can cost $15-25 which only lasts ~5 minutes (highly dependent on how heavy the quad is, the battery capacity, and how aggressive you're flying), so getting more to increase my time in the air is a goal. This ignores the mistakes and poor design decisions I made my first time around, which maybe my planned indoors-sized quad will fix...

This all assumes that I've got money left over after buying upgrades for my PC (my i7 950 is beginning to show its age, after all, and even though I have a GTX 980 running SLI or going to a GTX 1080/AMD equivalent would be nice). Golf. Golf trips. Golf equipment. Private golf clubs. Marching Band. It's hella expensive My husband and I got into playing boardgames like 5 years ago. Our collection has grown so much. I'm pretty sure sure we have spent $3000+ Also, we host a weekly game night with our friends once a week which includes alcohol and snacks. It may seem like not that much extra when grocery shopping, but when you're on a budget, it can get kind of rough. Although our friends do bring over occasional 12pks and liters of rum and stuff which is cool.  My wife says I have a knife fetish! I cook for a living and I use knives everyday sounds reasonable.Collecting anime figurines. Depending on which kind you get, it can get pretty expensive.Bird/wildlife watching. Starts out cheap (a pair of binoculars and a bird ID book), but if you get into it then you end up spending more and more on decent binoculars, spotting scope, DSLR and long lenses, camcorders, tripods, holidays to wildlife hotspots, more and more books...Wasting Time.

I was looking at buying apartments so I went to see how much a brand new one currently on production would cost. Anyway they gave me the rundown told me the prices then asked if I wanted to walk around. 

"Walk around?" I ask. 

"Yes if you follow me downstairs we have something new for customers to try" 

They took me into a basement room of their office and stuck a fucking oculus onto my head and said I can walk around their 3d representation of their new apartment complex.

Seriously my life has been *changed* in an almost miraculous fashion. Science fucking rocks. When my grandfather was born in the early 1900's we didn't know galaxies existed.   When my dad was born in 1935 we had just learned about cosmic radio waves but the radio telescope had not been built until 1937.   I was born in 1962, 3 years before Penzias and Wilson would discover the CMB radiation.    My Daughter was born in 1992, right about when the first extra-solar planet was detected.   And now we're finding them at an amazing clip and talking about detecting weather on other planets and measuring their atmospheric chemistry.So when I was little I dreamed of having I TV I could take with me everywhere. I was soooo excited to get one of those hand held TV's that had screen that was a bout 3" x 2" in a housing the size of a large walkie talkie. I would take it on car trip and try to use the long antena to pick up a station for a few moments when passing through a populated area. It was glorious!

And now? My childhood dream has come true! As long as I have wifi I can pretty much watch anything I want wherever I am in the world. It's fucking amazing! I curl up around my iPad at night as it is tucked closely beside me watching Netflix. And if I get tired of laying on that side, no problem! I can just roll over and take the TV with me!

Such an amazing world we live in! :) Last Christmas.  I had seen a video of a tour of the inside of the space station I wanted to show my niece.   I  google for it, clicked on what I thought was the right video and got a live feed from the space station instead.

So, I'm sitting on the couch, with a tablet, accidentally watching a live video stream from outer space, of a space station flying around the earth and I wasn't impressed.  I was just upset that it wasn't what I was looking for.

Edit: [Here's the stream.](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload)Streaming is kind of that way for me, but I was born in 1970.

I grew up with computers, but pretty much everything about the tech age still makes me smile, not because I am old, but because I really believed it would happen.Right now, Thanks for reminding me.


....written on my phone which functions as a camera,  light source, encyclopedia/dictionary, TV,  porn dispensary,  banking device,  writing tool, distance gauge,  metal detector, level, personal trainer,  rolodex, agenda, stereo, video recorder,  alarm clock, gaming system, dating coach, audio book library...
.....and that's just the apps I *use*I took BART train to San Francisco International Airport. After riding on the 10 car raised rail, I switched to an automated train that is raised and loops around the airport to all the terminals. Looking out the window one of the big international jets was sitting at one of the terminals. It was huge. 

I'm convinced the only reason we don't feel like we are in the future more often is because it's not nearly as clean as we thought it would be.Flying a plane. Also flying in a plane,  but especially flying it yourself. 

Humans have been on the planet for ~200,000 years, and for only 100 of those years has man been able to fly. That's 0.05% of human history. How many people over the course of history looked enviously at birds in the sky and thought 'I want to do *that*.' It's pretty amazing. The first time I had a video call with my wife while we were both walking around the city. I was in Montreal, she was in Seoul. Perfectly clear, no lag, video call around the world. I remember as a kid watching the Jetzons and thinking how impossible it was to have a device that easily allows you to call someone and *see their face at the same time*.

One day I finished a Skype call and was suddenly hit with the realization of how far we had come.As I wait for my HTC Vive virtual reality headset to arrive, I realize that I've been waiting for it for 25 years, and it's finally here.For me it was when I saw footage of a GoPro attached to an eagle soaring above some beautiful mountains. When I watched on a handheld device 2500 miles away live footage from a robot helicopter flying around a robot boat in the middle of the ocean as a fucking robot rocket landed on it from fucking outer space.

Edit* so it was a normal plane with a super awesome camera not a drone, however here is the video if you haven't seen the landing yet. https://youtu.be/sYmQQn_ZSysJust the other day playing CS:GO online. It suddenly occurred to me how incredibly fast our computers are communicating with each other, syncing our mouse movements and keystrokes within fractions of a second, from hundreds and even thousands of miles away from each other, to create a virtual world where we shoot guns at each other. 

And some ten year old is using this incredible piece of technology to scream through my speakers that he fucked my mom. When I watched my 13 year old son watch The Matrix for the first time. The scene where a helicopter pilot program is uploaded directly to the character almost instantly.  My son: "YouTube will figure out how to do that before I'm in college. "
 until he said that, I honestly had never given any thought to just how much information is constantly availible to anyone who wants to learn a new skill.It was ten or twelve years ago.   Husband and I are sitting in our basement den...he's in his 'spot' and I'm in mine.   We have our laptops open and are playing games against people online while watching a tv show we'd dvr'd the night before.  My phone chimed...it was my teenaged daughter texting from her bedroom upstairs to ask when and what dinner was going to be.

I responded to her text, looked at my husband and said, "we're the fucking Jetsons".   He nodded, and we both went back to our games.I can yell at my lights to turn them on, off, or to change their colorAfter staying in a third world country for a couple years, going back to a first world country is like stepping into a time machine. The internet is so much faster, new technologies are ubiquitous now. Slang is different and you are out of date with pop culture unless you happen to have spent so much of your time on the internet, which you can't because it's so slow. Everything is so new and nice and not beaten down; it makes you appreciate everything that much more.I was driving down the highway near an airport and saw a plane rise from beyond  the treeline ahead of all the cars on the road. Because of this image, it suddenly occurred to me how amazing our technology is. For a single moment I saw our time as someone from hundreds of years ago would see it.The fact that self driving cars are a thing and that I may get to own one someday. when I realized I can get pretty much anything I want from my phone while in bed.  Hungry? Order a pizza.  Single? Get on Tinder/Bumble.  Need a job? Open Indeed/Linkedin.  Need a suit for your date/interview?  Order one on Amazon.  Broke?  Have someone quickpay you on the Chase app.

I'm hard pressed to think of something you can't get from your phone these days.Microsoft accidentally created a neo-nazi sexbot. There is internet access in cars. 

Leisure space travel is a developing field. 

We can power cars with fuel produced by algae.Oct 21, 2015.  The day that Marty went into the future in Back to the Future.The Carbon 3D [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpH1zhUQY0c).My first smartphone. Those fellas are straight from sci-fi movies.When i got my very first smartphone. With a touchscreen! It still amazes me to this day that you touch a screen and you can make stuff happenWhen I realized that we are closer to the year 2030 than to the year 2000.  
  
Edit because I realized the year 200 was 1800 years ago.Well, I'm reading this thread from within a virtual reality spaceship environment courtesy of [Virtual Desktop](http://store.steampowered.com/app/382110/) with the [HTC Vive](http://store.steampowered.com/app/358040) on a screen whose size, distance, and curvature I control.

And this is only the beginning.Trying Oculus Rift this weekMine probably is a bit less of a moment for most people. I flew to Ireland with my family and my grandparents. My grandmother had been afraid of flying her whole life, and had never flown, but always wanted to go back to Ireland before she passed. She had been diagnosed with cancer, and got a bit of a fuck it attitude. I was sitting next to her, she was next to the window. I was sitting there relaxing listening to music getting ready for take off when she taps me on the shoulder and asks if I could play a song and let her listen to music as we take off so she can calm down. She makes her request, so I put on some Louis Armstrong, hand her my headphones and sit back. We start to take off, maybe a few hundred feet off the ground and I look over and she's crying so I hold her hand and she looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, "I'm not scared, I'm just amazed." At that moment it hit me, here is this 95 year old woman, born in 1910, who witnessed two World Wars, the Great Depression, and an unimaginable spread of technological innovation, sitting in a metal tube flying through air that instinct tells us is made of nothing, listening to her favorite musician watching the earth fall slowly away, heading back to her homeland that she left on a boat. Now whenever I fly, or even look up at an airplane crossing the sky, it hits me how incredible that really is. Watching the SpaceX landing from like three weeks ago. My fiancee and I just looked at each other and were like, "Wow, we're living in the fucking Space Age."

EDIT: Lots of replies bringing up good, valid points about prior advances in our space and aeronautics technology (and Civ V). I don't know why, but something about this particular event triggered a very strong reaction in me, even more so than landing a rover on Mars or a probe on a speeding comet. That time I was dying, but then didnt.Standing behind my mother and daughter as they used a star map on an iPad.  Hit me like a ton of bricks.When I bought my laptop.  Touch screens on EVERYTHING.  It was amazing.  I hadn't been in a computer store for six years, so my idea of what was current was a few years out of date.Everything in [this catalog](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-16-radioshackad.jpg) and more now fits into [devices like these.](http://howng.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ngrvanguard.com_.jpg) 

On a personal note, the fact that I can take pictures [like these](http://imgur.com/a/q9TQI) and instantly share them with friends around the world is a reminder of the time I live in, the interconnected digital age. 

Side note: [these pictures of Shanghai](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/urban-development-shanghai.jpg) is also a striking image of the future. The fact that you have the old and the future on opposite sides of a river really blows my mind. Parts of the movie "Her" were filmed in Shanghai *just for the setting*. When my friend gave me a ride in her Tesla.When I looked at the first photo I took of my own house I grew up in with my drone. It felt jaw-dropping to me. The thing I'm typing this message on while waiting for the lady to call my number so I can get my food has more computing power than the ships that took men to the moon.

...and yet we won't go back to the fucking moon.

Edit: Since this comment caught a bit of traction and everyone says the same thing: *there's no reason to go to the moon* -- here's 2 reasons that are huge.

1. Practice. Practice and experimentation on building and sustaining on a hazardous planet. We can discover problems we'll run into on Mars before we go to Mars, and how to address those problems. 

2. Community, economy and passion -- as a country. We, as Americans, have so little to be proud of right now. We have so little in common. We're a melting pot that's melting. We need something to share. A live streamed moon colony/mission would be *massive*. Everyone would watch, not just Americans -- but it would be *ours*, and we could really use that right now.I was driving home at night when I saw three lights appear in the sky in a triangle pattern. It moved fast, and then straight down too fast for an aircraft.  I waited to hear the helicopter crash, but nothing! Then I thought, Omg what the hell was that? A ufo, wtf?!  And then it dawned on me, it was a drone.... I felt like a cave person.when I saw the drink mix machine fast food restaurants like Wendys has. have you seen [this](http://www.coca-colacompany.com/content/dam/journey/us/en/private/2010/01/freestyle1-7d9ff257.jpg) shit?Playing Spotify for the first time on my phone. 

As a 90's kid, I'm still in awe at the fact that I have access to an ENTIRE music store worth of music on my phone for only $10/month. I used to buy a ton of tapes and CD's and $10 was the price of ONE CD on clearance or a regular priced cassette tape. 

I'm waiting for quantum computers. Quantum computers and we're living in the future.I'm only nineteen, so not a lot has blown me away so far. But, I remember watching the Microsoft presentation of their hololens, seeing minecraft rise from the table actually blew my mind. 

Holograms is something I always thought was distant future. And while this isn't how holograms are envisioned in sci-fi, it's close enoughThis happened a year or so ago (maybe longer):  I was walking into a McDonald's and noticed a guy on his iphone using sign language with a person on the other end.

we have made phones for the deaf and that is not even the intended function of the device.When Nestle said water wasn't a human right, I thought to myself, "Wow, so this is how the water war starts" I screen printed on a cake today. So, probably that. I saw a 3-4 year old child just a week ago, he was in a shopping mall and desperately slapping, prodding, and tapping a digital billboard, and growing increasingly frustrated when his touches weren't being registered. It was a non-touchscreen. 

I watched him for thirty seconds, and in my mind was "oh shit, this is the future."Two things, social rather than technical,
And related.

1) I married my partner last summer after 20 years together. In Georgia. Never thought that would happen in my lifetime.im still amazed.

2) My nephew came home from school one day and told my sister what he'd learned about the Matthew Sheppard murder. He was absolutely aghast and outraged. "They killed him just because he was gay!" In the same "can you believe this?" Tone that I would have had after learning about the Holocaust. It was literally unbelievable and completely shocking to him that this could happen. The Sheppard murder happened in 1998. He was born in 2000.  



The size of data storage. There are micro-USB sticks the size of your finger tip that hold 150+ gigabytes. You look at pictures of some of the first computers, one entire ROOM was mere kilobytes.I'm an operating room nurse (circulator).  A few days ago I was watching a robotic surgery while the surgeon was controlling the procedure from ten feet away from the patient.  Bray Wyatt's theme song was streaming on someone's iPhone during this time.  The OR can be a weird place.This was awhile ago (obviously) but the first time I played a Nintendo 64 blew me away in a way no interaction with any technology had done before or since.  Having grown up on the NES, SNES and Genesis, the transition to true 3d, especially since it came at a period in my life where I was growing bored with videogames, was like nothing I had ever experienced before.  I haven't had a chance to try any of the new VR goggles yet but I've heard some people say it was a similar experience for them.People are people. We could could pull anyone from any time and plop them right here and in two weeks they would be complaining about their internet speed or that someone is kicking the back of their seat on a 787.Not quite, but almost 10-years ago, I was riding passenger on a drive to Acadia National Park.  I get a call from my mother, "The email isn't working".

The App Store had recently come out for iOS and I had already purchased a VNC app, but hadn't used it.

I put mom on speaker phone, opened MochaVNC, set it up with mom's DynDNS info, took control of her Mac from the touch screen of my phone, fixed her settings and had her back in business.

60 miles an hour down a highway in Maine, controlling a computer in Boston, from the same device I was using to simultaneously conduct a phone conversation, and it all went smoothly.

After I hung up, I realized the fucking magic of what had just happened and proceeded to enjoy the following week in nature.Using Word Lens to translate a page of foreign language text into english in the live view of my iphone camera.I was walking in my neighborhood and a Roomba was discarded on the side of the road. We're throwing away robots!My toilet clogged and I went to Walmart to get an auger.

Think about it. I have a designated ROOM for deficating, in a specific item which captures and disposes of my waste with next to zero effort on my part. Then, when it experienced an error, I got in my 2 ton hunk of steel and listened to artificial sound transmitted through wireless Internet processed by satellites in SPACE. Then I went to a store which has literally every single thing I could reasonably need to survive to have this minor issue fixed in less than an hour. Then I bought a tool created by a company whose sole existence is creating tools to unclog these mysterious poop eating machines -- because we live in a system where people can make living wages off of such niche items and don't have to farm for their daily sustenance.This will get buried but I don't care. My kid said he needed to play an online game at a certain time, because he had arranged to get together with a group. I said OK (It was his normal game time) and asked what his friends names are. He gave me a couple, the added, "except this one guy. I can't pronounce his name. He lives in India."Internet on my phone.I bought a cupcake from a cupcake vending machine and paid with my phone. Mind blown.I went to an ice cream shop yesterday. Every cash register was a tablet, I paid with a phone (basically a pocketable computer) and when they ran out of a flavor the menu instantly changed. Then they went and made my ice cream with liquid nitrogen.

If he is trying to ACTIVELY TORTURE OR KILL ME?!?!?! nope nope nope nope noooooooooopeBarbra StreisandRob SchneiderLiam Neeson. It seems like he's an expert at it.I've already had a creepy dream where Brad Garret (from Everybody Loves Raymond) kidnapped me and made me live in a wood paneled basement.  Christopher Walken.

Woody Allen"I'm the only smart one here."At my high school graduation, our valedictorian began his speech with, "all men are not created equal." Naturally, we all assumed that he'd reflect the strength of diversity or whatever, because that's what a normal smart person should do for a commencement address.  Instead, he fluffed his own ego and his hard work for his GPA. He ended his speech with, "if you work hard, I hope to one day find you an equal." It was extremely uncomfortable. [deleted]"Man this whole new years thing is getting me down, looking back 2015s been a complete write off, I've made literally zero progress."

"Man I feel you, I only bought one property."

He's 25.A guy I used to work with.  "Her?  She wishes, she'd probably fuck you if I asked her to."Well my mother once told my family at dinner that she likes to host dinner parties because she loves feeling loved. Pretty normal, right?

But wait there's more. She then said she knows that people are enlightened by her presence because she is an "earth angel" and people can feel her strength and confidence. And then she went on to say that her "light" makes the people around her cry with joy. She then described all the people "flocking" to her to tell her how she's changed their lives and how she was brought to this earth to save them.

Childhood was interesting.I had a visiting instructor when I was in university who was pretty narcissistic "I am smarter than all of you" is something he said many times. 


I found it pretty baffling at the time that a man smarter than all of us picked the same smartphone as me considering all the flaws (this was pre iPhone )

Then one day he came in and said "I am so smart you know? I will put a test so easy but no one will pass. " and he did... It wouldn't get more narcissistic than putting a test to fail a class of 160 people just to prove you are smart.  I passed though, I think it's not really something they say specifically, but everytime I'm with people who are only waiting for me to shut up so they can listen to their own voice talking about themselves, I just wanna hand them a mirror and find something better to do with me limited life time.

"Because I know you."'you don't know what it's like to be me.' my mother when being called out on being a shitty person to her kids. she had some other good gems but after a while you just stop listening to them.Has anyone seen that Alaskan Bush People show on NatGeo (I think)? The kid who has a long ponytail and dresses in steampunk clothing is pretty narcissistic. He calls himself a genius and thinks he is god's gift to everyone because he knows electrical wiring stuff. I mean, he seems pretty smart, but that much narcissism just kills any credibility to me. Not that he had much in the first place because those kids are not socialized. I just ended up watching like 3 episodes in a row when it was on the other day, and the weirdness made for some awesomely shitty television. This one unfortunately was said by me.
"Why did she say no?"

"I don't know, but, let's be honest, I would have been doing her a favor."

The people I was sitting with did not agree with that at all. And rightfully so.I was doing some volunteer work, and we were working in small groups. A man who worked for the organization came over and helped a little, then went to talk on his phone. When we were finished with that section, he inspected it and said, "You can tell when it's my work because it's done well." We literally did the work. Everyone just looked at him like they he was crazy.This new kid moved to our high school from Dallas. His dad was some high-ranking guy at Eastman, so he was very well-off: always dressed very preppy, bragged that his dad was buying him a Porsche for his first car, etc.
One day he was being his usual prick self when a girl asked him if he thought he was better than her. He responded with, "Yeah, I have more money than any of you" in front of the entire classroom."The party was really lame when I showed up. It didn't really start until I got there."I have a cousin who's obsessed with her cats.  My family were visiting one Christmas and my sister is severely allergic to cats.  

My sister was pregnant at the time but not yet at 12 weeks so hadn't told everyone.  She also couldn't take her usual allergy medication due to being preggers.  

So when she started to have a reaction to the cats she excused herself and said she'd have to go home.  My cousin piped up aren't allergies mainly in people's heads?

About a year and later my cousin was visiting my sister and her twins and she kept referring to the babies at it instead of he or she.  After about 15 minutes she said you know babies just aren't as interesting as cats and left. "People must hate me because I always leave plenty of space behind my BMW when I park" 
-one of my d-bag neighbors I overheard on the streetMy husband's son (thank *God* I'm not related to that kid by blood...) is a psychotic motherfucker.  We're talking future murderer/rapist psychotic.  Lots of issues, that kid has, that all stem from his literal-waste-of-oxygen mother.  Doesn't live with us, since he's almost 21, and too crazy to be around us.  Aaanyway, I asked my husband once about when he realized the bastard was crazy, and the response was, "I saw it a LOT earlier than everyone else did.  I noticed it at about 5 when he tried to stuff my parents' two small dogs under the couch and laughed a really creepy laugh when they yelped in pain."  My husband was in the Army for a long time, been all over the world, etc, and said that was the creepiest laugh he had ever come across from a kid.One of our friends is dating a woman with a hellion for a child, who is 6 years old. This kid asked our friend for a hug, then sucker punched him in the face. Then yesterday we had a party and he spent the entire night assaulting our friend. He turned his sights on my husband, who is a no-go for being physically attacked by a kid, I even warned the mom, who was standing around, oblivious, "XX, DH is not kidding when he says he'll retaliate."

(I should mention at this point that DH and I own a martial arts school, the BF is one of our instructors, the mom is one of our students.)

Anyway, kid puts his hands on DH and DH then corners him and says in his best threatening voice for him not to ever lay a hand on him again. It was probably the first time he has ever been corrected by anyone about this and he looked like he was scared shitless.

We spoke with the BF and he said the mom just doesn't see it and the kid is just angry all the time. She doesn't correct him or anything. We said she needs to get him under control before he grows up and tries this shit on someone who won't take it. She's a mom who literally showed me a video of her kid kicking and screaming in the back seat, "I'm going to kill you! I hate you!" and who thought that was "cute."

No lady, a 6 year old psychopath is not ever going to be "cute."a family friend's son. He is 26ish now and has at least 9 felonies that i know of. was such a sweet kid growing up. but had terrible ADHD so mom put him into martial arts to help him get some self control. BIG mistake. ended up getting to the top levels and just used all that knowledge and power to help him commit terrible terrible crimes. Well when he was 17ish ended up in corrections or whatever it is called. mom keep taking him back for years. one day he burned her house down. that's when she got it. She stopped returning his calls, had a restraining order put on him. I'm glad she realized and could start protecting herself.My son when he was 14 threw a shovel at a girls head, when I questioned him later he showed no remorse or understanding of what he'd done. She went to hospital for a week, with a pretty severe head wound and swelling. We sent him to therapy then, but he showed no progress for months. Nowadays we don't often speak to Jeremy, and it saddens me to think about what he might be doing each night since he moved away. I suppose that was the first time I really knew our son was a bit of a monster.My mom says it was when my brother was 3. 

It was the mid 80's and he used to beat the shit out of us whenever we stepped "outta line" so my mom took him to a therapist to have him evaluated.  He managed to convince the doctor that my mother was hitting us.  She was spanking, but my brother made it sound like she used him as a punching bag, and Child Protective Services had to investigate.  Nothing came of it,but my parents yanked him from therapy; my parents were too afraid to discipline him ever since, and he basically emotionally scarred the shit out of us other 3 siblings.  

Now he's a 34 year old x navy hoarder that "remodels reclaimed properties", and lives on his own.  He has girlfriends, but eventually he breaks them down so hard they either get smart and run, or they snap and either become alcoholics or try to kill him.  The "love of his life" did both.Who knows what parents realize and when - my mom had 3 kids. My (much older) sister has been a completely horrid asshole since the day she was born. My brother is a self destructive nightmare. They're both serious drug addicts. I'm a nice person and got the fuck out of my mom's way as soon as I could. At what point did she realize she raised assholes? I can't tell you that. My siblings 100% ruined my mother's life and caused her premature death, and until the very end she never quite "got it" that she needed to kick them to the curb. She let them siphon every penny and ounce of energy out of her, use her, steal from her, cause her to lose her HOME and her car....they could have murdered someone and she'd help them bury the body. Any time I asked her what the fuuuuuuck went through her head she always just said, "you don't know what it's like to love your children no matter what." Really interested to see other parents' replies on this thread. Very late to the party, but I need to vent: 

I can't speak for my mom, but I first realized my brother is a shitty person when he kicked her out of her house (he was living with her) on Christmas Eve one year because he was throwing a party he'd been planning "for a long time" (he was 27, if that matters). Mom and my (then-9-year-old) half-brother had plans, but had to cancel because they got sick and wanted to spend a quiet evening at home. Older bro generously booked them a hotel room for the night, which was where she called me from in tears. 

He'd always been a self-centered, sensitive asshole but that was when it finally dawned on me that he wasn't a good person. The good news is that he's cut me out of his life over a facebook post I made (I complained that I had to buy my own car when our parents bought him three so far because he keeps wrecking them). He sent me an angry text that he doesn't want to speak to me for the rest of my life (he specified *my* life because I'm a terminal cancer patient) and ignored all my attempts to apologize. I cried for hours, but the next day I realized I'm way better off without him.

Thanks for posting this thread, it felt good to get that off my shoulders.I have a son who has been living with us his whole life and has repeatedly barged into our room stumbling whilst throwing up and shitting himself making us clean up the mess. He's never paid for a single meal and continues to never communicate with us what he is doing in his life.

But he turns 2 this month so I guess it's okay.Throwaway name

I know some parents that said they knew their oldest was a jerk since he was about 1 year old. They said the only time in his life that he went out of his way to be kind is when the mom was pregnant with her second child. The oldest was about 3 and he did everything he could to take care of her and it immediately stopped when the baby was born.

Now he's in his 30's and has been in and out of jail a few times, has had DV charges pretty much from every girlfriend. He has little to do with his kid. However he has maintained a decent job with good salary, so he's not a total burden to society.

Now the parents say the second kid is their "sweet" and "nice" kid. No, he's just smarter than the older one and easily manipulates them. He's equally as abusive as the older one, but hides it better.ITT: no parents of assholes.The kid next door to us was a real dick.  You know when someone has a serious brain wiring problem and he did.  He was always manic, got into drugs in junior high, would punch people uncontrollably.  It was like he had a demon inside of him.  The family kept saying he would grow out of it.  Right up to the day he was standing on the front rail of a ski boat going bat-out-of-hell across a lake and fell forward.  The motor sliced him right down the middle.My girlfriend's 5 year old. The first time I saw an extremely friendly dog run from her I raised an eyebrow. Then I got to see her try to control the world and just be a general a-hole. It blows my mind how animals see right through people...

Edit: apostrophe and on a side note I have been with my girlfriend a few years now and I've noticed the more I've helped correct the behaviors the more animals are willing to spend time around her. Still don't flock to her but they don't run away as fast any more...
When she cheated on her husband, got pregnant, and called her mom excited about the pregnancy.Have worked with kids for most of my adult life. My rule of thumb is, for any child, find a way to get some rules and boundaries laid out before they hit the five year old mark. After that, nothing but psychiatric help will sort out ingrained behavior patterns. I've worked with violent kids, kids with incredibly high IQs, kids on the autistic spectrum, you name it. I've never had a child I couldn't find a way to connect with, and the result is kids will do things for me that they would never do for their parents. 

Because of my history, I can see where and when the bond between parent and child has been broken and when a family is on the path of raising a bad person. Some have mothers with untreated post-natal depression and the resulting dark mood hanging over the household means the kids grow up unsettled, and that's when I step in to offer stability. Honestly, as far as I'm concerned there is no such thing as a bad kid, just a bad environment. 

Now, of the people I know who are awful, I can see exactly what happened to make them that way. 

A)Narc cousin, first child of young parents, poverty in the formative years, post-natal depression in mother, violence in the house that I witnessed as a child, father is an emotional black hole. All of those cousins have troubled backgrounds but the other three have more or less sorted themselves out, the oldest is just too far gone

B) Histrionic ex-friend. Last child of four, spoiled due to medical issue that is completely livable with but is treated like it's a serious life threatening illness, mother died in late teen years, father cheated on dying mother, adult siblings far too involved in each other's lives, and a lack of people that have said no to her

C) Short term acquaintance, father was a gun nut who talked multiple times about the people he's killed when I met him once, mother is hypochondriac and very indulgent, the youngest child of five whose siblings fled the house as soon as they could

D) My narc mother, who had to share her childhood bedroom with her chain-smoking aunt who gave her lifelong lung problems, violent mother, father who worked abroad for her formative years, has an identical twin sister (the mother of narc cousin) and a fractious relationship with her other siblings, did not really want to have children and mostly got married to get away from her mother, very very frustrated that she didn't get the daughter she wanted, she got me instead. My aunt has two of the nicest children I've ever met. They're smart, kind, and funny, and love everyone to bits. 

And then there's the other one. 

my aunt knew her children were assholes from before they were born. She didn't want a kid... So instead she had 3 with a guy she knew was cheating on her. But she had three and it was done, and now she's a single mom who absolutely hates her kids. She does anything to avoid spending time with them. 


As I said, the youngest two are as great as they can be in such a predicament. She despises them the most. I've never seen her speak with either beyond simple commands. 


The oldest is a pizza shit. He's the worst person I have ever met. And she ADORES him. He hits his younger sister in the face? Well obviously she was annoying him. He punches every man he meets in the junk? Oh, he's just playing!! He refuses to call any of us by our familiar titles (he won't say "grandma and grandpa", he calls my grandma either by her first name or "toots".... A far cry better than childhood, when he'd call her "sugartits" cause he heard it on TV)

He's abusive, obnoxious, and overall horrible. My aunt has yet to recognize this. We all knew it from the day he was born. I used to be friends with the guy linked below. I don't know the moment his parents realized they had a bad kid. Probably sometime before dismantling them with power tools.

http://www.lfpress.com/2016/04/26/jeremy-gubbels-pleaded-guilty-to-killing-his-parents-mario-and-susan-gubbels-of-watfordUnfortunately it seems like my 15yo niece (my sister's daughter) is going down that path.

She's been dating this 18 year old boy for 3 years (since she was *12* and he was 15), a guy who has previously been to juvie for stealing and vandalism, and my niece is following in his footsteps. She's stolen my sister's entire paycheck out of her wallet, stolen valuables from the house, stolen her younger brother's video games and electronics, pretty much anything that isn't nailed down she'll take. She's gotten into multiple physical altercations with my sister and with teachers at her school (when she *does* go to school, that is, which isn't often).

For about a year my sister sent her to another state to live with an older family member thinking that would help calm her down and it *did*. She stopped all of the behavior, started going to school there and was doing very well, and seemed to be adjusting amazingly...and then my sister decided that she 'missed her' and brought her back and the behavior started again even worse than before. 

I think it was a major fuck up on my sister's part to bring her back because just as she was finally adjusting and in a situation that was healthy she got ripped out of it. Frankly I think sending her away was the best parenting move my sister ever made. She got pregnant with my niece when she was 17 and their relationship has never been that great. She never set consequences for her. She'd just buy her whatever she wanted and nothing else and drop her off at her grandparents all the time and thought that buying her affection meant she was being a good parent. And then she got married to a guy and had *another* kid and my niece ended up basically being pushed aside and ignored as the 'hanger on'. 

I don't know what can be done at this point to change anything. Our mother tries as much as she can as does the rest of the family but there's only so much we can do when her mother refuses to do anything.

My mom would probably tell you it was the day I voted republican.We need a r/RaisedANarcissist When he kept insisting to everyone on the street that he was black, despite clearly being Steve Martin.I think my dad thinks I'm a jerk. I'm 27 and have been away for home for a few years now. A couple of years ago his girlfriend kicked him out because he was drinking too much and starting to fall off the addiction wagon again. He had to move in with me for a few months. During that time I slowly lost more and more respect for him. I seen what kind of a weak willed person he had become. I slowly began to resent him and his out bursts. He had been like this my entire life. Never abusive but always a train wreck. I just didn't respect him. He has gotten his shit back together lately but I'm afraid that if something doesn't work out for him, he will fall back off the wagon. Some times I accidentally talk down to him. I would never want to make him feel bad, he's my dad and I care very much for him and he has always cared about me. But I forget sometimes.Not my kid but my ex. When I was younger, I was an intern for my mom at her work, and when I was in my second year there I decided to move departments because my mom (still is) is an abusive woman. I interned for John (names changed) and became really close friends with him. I let him know the problems at my house (I was being emotionally abused along with being blackmailed to be a good kid) and he offered me a place to stay to finish up my highschool years and go to community college.

I took the offer (yes, I let my parents know so John wasn't going to be arrested) and left as soon as I could. During all of this, I was dating his son Asshole 1 and was becoming good friends with his daughter, Asshole 2. Asshole 1 and I attended the same school and often stuck together, at home and school. This caused problems as we kept rubbing against each other all the time and had NO breaks.

Eventually, John and his wife had started up a brewery. It basically took the time that would be able to give to his 2 stressed out children (Asshole 2 has spina bifuda) and basically left him tired all the time. His son basically turned into an asshole because his father never paid attention to him, and he eventually turned into someone who spread lies and rumors. 

I moved out of that house and with my current boyfriend, and when I talk to his dad every once and a while, he admits that the time that his wife and him devoted to the brewery (which may break since a divorce is on the horizon) turned his son into an asshole.[I know this guy,] (https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/169507/man-accused-of-sex-atacks-on-dundee-college-campus/) totally saw it coming. His parents are arseholes. My mom's prediction that I would have children who would exhibit worse behavior than I did was wrong.... 

Does this make me the Jerk?when the youngest couldn't wait to vote for bush; when the oldest totaled the car we gave him while driving drunk and flipped us off and tried to walk home after going to bail him out of jail the next morning.My 5 month is an angel but my mom had a friend whose son was the biggest bully I've known. I didn't see him too often but when I did he just talked shot and would push me around since he was bigger. Last I heard he started a girls hair on fire on a school bus and went to jail. His mom still didn't think he was a bad kid after thatMy cousin (12) is a spoiled little brat.  She's the youngest cousin by about 4 years, and so she has always been babied by everyone in the family.  She is my aunt's only child, and she is "especially precious" because my aunt couldn't have children and so my cousin is adopted.  (I'm also adopted, I'm not hating on adopted families).

Anyway, cousin is in her first year of middle school and is already a little Mean Girl.  She's the queen of her clique and brags about how popular she is.  She gets everything she wants.

When she was little, she was always cuddly and happy and wanted hugs and to play; now, she won't even come down out of her room at family parties.  If we're not at her house, she sits in a corner on her iPhone and ignores everyone.  She won't make eye contact with anyone, let alone hug them or talk. My aunt says she has "anxiety issues" but we all know the truth: cousin is a manipulative little bitch who is stringing my aunt along for money.  Oh, did I forget to mention?  For positive instances of family interaction, or passing a test, etc., my aunt pays her $100 cash.

My other cousin, who is a clinical social worker, called my aunt out on this in front of bratty cousin last week and my aunt EXPLODED.  The whole family and all of my aunt's friends have been trying to make her see what an entitled little shit she is raising but she won't listen to any of it.


Best part is, when I was a (fairly troublesome) teenager, my aunt is the one who would come and talk to me about my behavior and getting my shit together.  But god forbid anyone tries to tell her that her daughter isn't a perfect angel!I love my son. He has a good heart. Hell give you the shirt (probably filthy) off his back if he thinks you need it worse than him, but from a very early age, the women in his life fell for every lie, and exaggeration he perpetrated. As a result, I believe, he is a compulsive liar. I don't speak to him much because I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get truth out of him. Funny how no ones talking about their kid since theyre all stuck up thinking their kid is a miricle childbad parents make bad kidsITT: People talking about other people's kids because the parents themselves never actually realize.As the younger brother of someone who is a near constant arsehole to our parents the truth is most decent parents won't admit that their kid turned out a bad person. They just see themselves as the blame, that they did something wrong or try to find explanations such as mental illness (to be fair he's been diagnosed but nothing finite, either way he's still a fully functioning adult, no learning disabilities). I remember him always being a little shit, he hated seeing my parents giving me praise. My parents always describe it misbehaving as a child, pulling fire alarms and destroying shop displays as well.

I feel a lot of it does come from my parents being too lenient on him or not encouraging empathy at least. That's the biggest tell if you ask me, if you can see that your child can't recognise the negative feelings they're producing in others by the age of 8 then you need to get them help. You shouldn't consider it just a phase by that point, children are a lot smarter than most adults give them credit, they have the emotional capacity to recognise emotional pain in others by 8 (baring learning difficulties which in itself requires them getting extra help)  ultimately they're not doing so for other reasons and need to understand how it feels to be on the end of the abuse they generate.My uncle abused his own blind mother (my grandma) for money when he is just as easily capable of working himself. My parents refuse to tell me the details because it's a "sensitive" matter, even after my grandma's passing about 2 years ago.On the bright side... many of the kids described here have the potential to someday win the GOP nomination for president. My older sister is a goddamn bitch. My parents realized this 2 years ago when my younger sister and I went to go live with her and her family to finish high school. This is actually my cousin and not my child, but he started out awesome. He was really bright, everyone loved to be around him, and made it to state in track and cross country without really even trying. Then he got into some hardcore drugs and threw everything away. Got multiple women pregnant, disowned by his parents, lots of bad stuff.The room.

The next day I checked my spare and it was useless so I replaced it. The very next day after it was replaced I had a flat and needed it. Why would anyone ever dream about a spare tire?When my wife was pregnant with our first, pretty close to the due date, I woke up in the middle of the night and there was a man in our bedroom. 

I felt a complete and total calm wash over me as I recognized him as my grandfather who'd passed away many year prior. He was standing in this pose I remember where he'd be inspecting something kind of hunched forward with his hands clasped behind his back.

He was looking out the window and it was as though he was there to tell me that everything was going to work out just fine. 

Can't explain that at all.When I was a teenager we used to live in a big house with lots of relatives. My father's great aunt who was in her 80s had the room next to me. She used to make pretty distinctive noises with her Walker when she moved around. Then she turned 90 and passed away peacefully in her sleep. For at least three months after that I heard those noises coming from her locked vacant room. In 11th grade I slept over my friends house. They had a door that led up to the attic that only the owner of the house had a key to. They rented the house. They told me they weren't here weird things up there which I didn't believe. But one night when we were up there drinking their moms Wild Irish Rose liquor I kid you not that fucking doorknob jiggled.  everyone else was asleep and to this day I don't know if I was hallucinating that shit or if it really happened but damn...
Posted this once before but it is still unexplained. I was watching house of cards with my boyfriend. He goes to grab a new beer and on his way back, he notices a spill on the coffee table. The table had just been cleared of dinner dishes (none of which had anything on them that could have caused a spill like this), and he and I both had our feet up.The light is on and I can tell the spill is bright red. He asks if I'm bleeding and since I had just washed dishes(knives) after dinner, I checked. He also checked. Neither of us are bleeding.I grabbed toilet paper and swabbed it to get an idea of the color and texture. There was about a tablespoon of it and no drops anywhere else. It's remarkably like blood but nothing around could have spilled besides beer and neither of us are bleeding.I looked anywhere for anything that could have spilled. The coffee table is wood and clear lacquered. There are no red fabrics it anything that could have had red dye pulled from it. Neither of us were wearing anything red.I took photos of the toilet paper that I swabbed the spill up with before and after it dried. It was bright red and then later it dried darker brown-red. Any ideas? It still freaks me out to think about not having an explanation.My friend passed away. I hadn't talked to him for about 6 months due to a falling out and moving away. He had a really bad asthma attack and couldn't be revived.

One day I sat down at my computer and type in "Myspace.com" - I swear, without typing anything else, it goes to his profile which I don't think I had ever seen. I see in the comments that, that morning, everyone was typing in "RIP Brandon Ward"

Sure enough, he had passed away. I really questioned shit there for a minute.I hope this thread blows up. These are my favorite kind of Ask Reddit threads. I lived in Mexico for a time.  My roommate and I would bolt lock our front door and then, many times at night, we would hear it unlock and run downstairs to find the door completely open.  We tried changing the lock, using separate add on locks etc.  Happened so much we just moved.  We couldn't tell if we had a shitty neighbor or our door was possessed (we aren't superstitious, but it was still freaky).  That was a dangerous neighborhood.I lived alone in a very old stone house, with super high ceilings. Every now and then I would be sitting in my room, and there would be a crack/pop sound, and a big flash of light could come off one of my walls. It always came from the same wall. It was Christmas morning, and I was like 10 years old. I went and woke up my grandparents at about 6:30 in the morning. I distinctly remember seeing a little girl crawl out of the bottom of the bed they were sleeping in and stand in front of me. In the dim light, she looked similar to my cousin. Small, dark hair. I asked why she was in their bed and they said she wasn't. She then vanished in front of me. Weird. I was staring at a metal table when it suddenly got a big scratch across it. The scratch wasn't there before, and nothing in the room touched it. It just appeared right before my eyes.I was smoking a cigarette outside one night, walk over to my fence to pee, and suddenly there was this huge bright white light behind me. When I turned to look at it, I just saw a bright white orb in the air. The light went away like a second after I looked at it. There were no light poles any were near it, and I didn't hear a thing. This is weird and hard to explain, so I will give some context/background. 

This happened in the late 90's when I was a pre-teen. I had a mix-CD from a friend that I left on repeat and was slowly learning some great songs (and some familiar songs as well). 

I had listened to this CD several times in a row at this point so at the end of each song I would try to remember which song was next, usually by singing it in my head. I was a weird child, I like memorizing things, so I was trying to memorize this mix-CD.

One song wrapped up, so I started humming what I thought was the beginning of the next song, and I was right! It sounded a little weird though, kind of garbled and far away so I grabbed the CD case and looked at what the song was called. Except the song listed as next, track 6 or whatever, was a song I knew, and the song playing was not that. I looked back at the stereo and it still said track 6, so I hit the rewind button to see if maybe it was on random. It went back to 5, so I hit forward and went to the correct song, the one that I knew (the correct track 6), not the one that had been playing. So my stereo played the song that I hummed. It was very strange. 

I thought it was a creepy coincidence, only when the song that I had been humming came back on the intro was different. When it got to the chorus I realized I had been humming the chorus. Which is what the stereo played. So not only did my stereo play the song that I was humming, but skipped to the part of the song that I was humming.

I was so freaked out I unplugged my stereo, brought it to my brother and told him to keep it.Once when I was about 11 years old a saw a black helicopter flying unusually low near a small crick in in my nieghbots back yard. It hovered over it for only a few seconds before a small black box-like object was released from the bottom of the craft.  I remember spending weeks trying to go back to the place where it was dropped from the helicopter but never found a thing.  the helicopter was very strange, all black and markings. Could never explain itI have met a man with this 'power' of releasing electricity from his hands. He's using it to open a massage business. I've asked him how, and he simply said "I absorb this power from the earth". 


I swear to God, he touched my head and it feels exactly like being electrocuted. He could go all Pikachu or simply a light zap. The only downside is that he said he can't use the power for too long at a time, as if he needs to 'recharge'. I had this little necklace that was without a chain, of St. Dymphna. After searching I found a spare necklace chain that looks like this. I was in my room and couldn't get the chain on it for the life of me, so I left out of frustration. Came back about 15 minutes later and it was perfectly intact, with the St. Dymphna design centered on the chain.


Second time- I was with my cousin in my bedroom and I was searching frantically through my backpack for a pair of earrings that belonged to my mother. Was certain that I lost them. I was crying and felt defeated after searching through the whole damn backpack. Spoke with my cousin for a minute, then looked one last time in the backpack and the earrings were sitting very visibly in the front pouch. They were definitely not there a moment before, and my cousin came in no contact with the backpack.


Third and final time. Similar necklace chain as mentioned in the first story, different necklace design. Was trying to take it off, and in my bedroom again. Couldn't get the chain off. Left for a bit. Came back and the chain and the necklace were removed from each other, sitting nicely on my bed.Absolutely tripping out after smoking weed. Having oev and just really weird. Looking at a picture of my then crush and then have floating fractal hearts in my visual field. Looking back I was just psychotic I was at Niagara Falls and I stared at a flock of birds down below. They began to fly upwards and formed a globe formation. They continued to fly in a globe shape until I looked away.When I was a kid, at my old house, there were large window panels in front of my bed. I don't usually like to use the curtains because I find the moonlight quite pleasant. Anyways, from my bedroom, out the window, I can see my parents' room's balcony which sticks out (bedrooms were on the second floor). One night, I had trouble sleeping and woke up slightly dizzy. I looked out the window and saw a skeleton very slowly climbing up the walls to my parents' balcony. It was the creepiest thing I've seen and I'll never forget it.My sister waking me up in a dream to tell me goodbye. The dream itself was really bizarre because I had sleep paralysis in the dream. But I could hear my sister's voice calling to me and telling me to wake up, she'd come to say goodbye. In my dream I could move more than I could in regular paralysis, but it was like I'd had a stroke. But sort of dragging half my body upright, I turned and felt around the bed and could feel a body. I put my arms around it and gave it a hug. At this point I was now standing in my room and it was morning. I could see a beautiful morning light shining in from the curtains. I felt as though I couldn't look at my sister directly and I've always described it as though she were somehow too bright to look at? But I knew she was there. I told her we had to go see my mother, because she would want to say goodbye to her too. At that, I woke up.

It was about 6am and dark out and I was scared shitless. This dream had felt so real and jarring. I have never ever dreamed of anyone saying goodbye to me like this before. I had no reason to worry about her as she had no medical conditions that I'd known of, so it wasn't like it was relating to some idea of something happening with her. But I was convinced if I went back to bed, I'd wake up again and see her standing at the side of my bed.

It was because of the dream I called my mother to check on her, and my mother who's a stone cold atheist and hates stuff like this thought I was being strange but it's not like I ever call her up over things like this before. So she starts making calls, and it's because of the dream we found out she'd been rushed to hospital. 

She thankfully survived and has no recollection of anything involving what had happened. But my mother still asks me about that dream from time to time. 

I've had other dreams involving a weird connection too - very vivid dreams of staring right at someone I hadn't seen or thought about in years. A very very haunting dream of this guy and me just staring at each other. 2 days later I get a letter in the post and it's him saying his mother had died recently and it had made him think of me as I'd been close to her.

Stuff like that just makes me believe that maybe there is a type of connection we have as people, that something of us exists outside of us too.I don't know how or why but my television bleeds. When footprints started appearing inside my cupboard. Upside down. Wiped it and it started again .I swear this is true. I have the only key . And I have many who witnessed thisYou have to take empty box training to know how to handle boxes that are, you know, empty.I'm not allowed to contact mall security or the police without District Manager approval. 

I could have been just robbed at gun point in my store. My first call is supposed to be my DM to tell them I got robbed and "can I pretty please call the police?"

Edit- there's been some speculation/ questions as to why this rule is in place. The store is a high end retailer, so apparently it's because they don't want the negativity that is the police or mall security showing up being associated with the brand. I'm a librarian. If somebody asks me where anything is, I have to redirect them to the front desk. No matter what.

*Example of how this is dumb:*

"Where's the bathroom?" 

I'm pretty sure the front desk can help you with that.

If two snacks fall from the vending machine, we have to turn in the extra one or its considered "stealing company property". Had a manager follow me to the front desk to turn in some cookies last week.Well, today I got sent home for wearing the new uniform I was just issued and told to change back into the old one. I guess they haven't officially started the new uniform yet. The thing is, I'm the only security guard at an empty building with no one at it to even see me. All I did was trade a gray shirt for a white one. All the markings are the same. 

Seems pointless to me. I work for a very superstitious Korean man. The rules are no red pens, no shaking your legs and no whistling after the sun goes down. These aren't official 'rules', but he gets very serious about these things and doesn't allow joking about ghosts/the supernatural.

Late edit: Guys, I AM Korean. We're not allowed to laugh out loud.  My boss thinks we're secretly laughing at her.  And yes.if the microwave and printer run at the same time it trips a breaker that only property management can reset. So whenever anyone microwaves somegthing they have to yell 'MICROWAVE!' so nobody prints.A long time ago I worked at a Navy shipyard.  There were two rules re: first aid kits at each work site.  The OSHA type part of the organization had a rule that each work site had to have a first aid kit.  The org that ran the Workmans Comp stuff had a rule that first aid kits were prohibited at work sites; any injury had to go to the industrial dispensary to establish a paper trail.  

Work site supervisors were screwed if they had a first aid kit, they were screwed if they didn't have one.

The Shipyard Commander, a four-striper, called the heads of each organization into his conference room.  He told them "When you two come to an agreement about first aid kits, call my office.  I will have the Marine at the door let you out.  I'm tired of hearing about fucking first aid kits."We have to know where all the fire extinguishers are, but we're not supposed to put out the fire.I can wear any color jeans except blue.  No minifridges on even floor numbers.

 That sounds absurd, but the kitchenettes are on floors 1 and 3.We are not allowed to refer to the Xerox Machine as "Bob Marley" any more even though it still jamms way more than it Xeroxxes. This is because apparently the CEO had tween daughter come one day and she got very upset when she thought the staff were keeping her from seeing Bob Marley in real life. She did not know that Bob Marley is dead. This made the  CEO got stressed out and yell at us about the nick name. Gmail is blocked. Facebook & Twitter are not. We can expense starbucks, but not food from starbucks, because one guy was living off of Starbucks food for 3 months, worst part was that he was an extremely well paid engineer, but frugal as fuck.In our small hospital department, there's on oxygen line w/ a giant on/off valve that only affects our small department. If there's a fire, I can't turn the valve to close it. I have to call the nursing supervisor who is off-site, to come down to the fire and turn it off for me. I am not familiar enough with the rules of my job to choose the dumbest one, but at my old job, if a customer purchased something, then made it to the door with merchandise he or she didn't pay for, the cashier that rang them up was held accountable for it.Because of some new shits we got working who don't understand the concept of not using a phone when there is work to be done, everyone has to put their cell phone in a bucket at 6 P.M. (or whenever the evening rush starts). Fuck you, Kerrigan.We're not technically allowed to talk about our salaries with each other even though the amount we each individually make is a matter of public record. That means that if you get a promotion, you have to either file a public records request to find out what your peers are making (and therefore piss off your new boss) or you have to violate the directive.  It makes it pretty darn hard for an employee to negotiate.


Edited to add content:  I live in the US. I didn't know this was illegal, I just thought it was a dumb rule. Thanks for letting me know!  The majority of people I work with have either been explicitly told we can't talk about it or implicitly discouraged.  Last time I negotiated my salary, I was verbally reprimanded for having polled coworkers.  I told the manager that in light of my work product I deserved to be paid at least a specific amount. When they asked my reasoning for the number, I told them the truth.  Now that I know it's illegal, I'm livid. I'm entrusted with the care of mentally handicapped clients, including being trained in first aid, CPR, and the Heimlich Maneuver.... but apparently changing a light bulb or adjusting the thermostat in the group home where I work is too big a responsibility for me to be allowed to do.

EDIT:  Where I work is NOT unionized, since so many people seem to be commenting about unions.We are not to discuss politics on our personal social media account.You cannot leave 250 miles of the area without getting your request to leave said area approved. And you have to take lots of online and in person classes on how to be safe, not to beat your wife, not to drink n drive, and how to not be stressed out.

And wear a reflective belt everywhere.Women aren't allowed to lift anything. Literally anything. I was going to dump a trash can full of shredded paper in the dumpster last week and my boss caught me, made me put the trash can down, and go find someone to dump it for me. I was literally lifting the thing with one hand. 


As my job requires a lot of lifting and I hate asking for help constantly, I have mastered the art of picking up 50+ lb boxes and running with them so no one catches me.Do not throw any personal items in company dumpsters or waste receptacles. All items to be discarded *must* be taken home.I work construction. We're not allowed to tell the new guys how many newbies died in their first week. Young guys don't naturally think about safety, they think they'll live forever. Yeah gravity doesn't give a shit what you think, stay away from the ledges and open elevator shafts. 


**edit**

Ok this is getting some attention, lots of messages. My post here and further down isn't very clear.  So let me explain. 

1) when we say guys die in their first week, we really mean they die before they know the risks of the job. The time frame isn't always a week from when then start.

2) the company I work for a huge. We have 20,000 employees working at over 65 main sites. Much of that is at industrial sites in the oil/gas field. The work is dangerous 

3) Safety is a huge priority for the company. You won't stay employed if you don't take safety seriously. 

4) everyone that starts is told of all the dangers of the job. We don't hide that from them. 

5) The Bo's doesn't want us mentioning the deaths because it brings back alot of bad memories for the guys who were there. And the new guys usually think we're either making shit up, trying to scare them, or they just don't care. So it doesn't really make them think of act in a safe manner. I think they should know. 

6) Just because we don't specifically talk about the deaths doesn't mean we don't talk about previous accidents and Safety issues. We do, in detail.

7) construction is fucking dangerous. Most newbies just don't get that. 

8) if and when someone dies or is seriously hurt all work is stopped, at 20,000 + of us stop working. We all, in our teams, go over what happened. What could be done to prevent it. And if safety procedures weren't followed, we go over what the procedure is and why following it what have prevented the accident. 

9) with all that in place, it doesn't matter. Shit keeps happening. It's bad, it's the worse part of the job. And it can really fuck with your mind. 

10) no one who runs a team gets to that point t without proving they know their shit, proving that they work in a safe manner, and more importantly that they look out for the guys/girls who work with them. 

~~10~~ 11) below I mentioned that more construction workers died in my city last year than cops. I said that should change. In that I want people to stop dying, not that I want more cops to die. Cops shouldn't die at work either. People usually believe that being a cop, fireman, soldier are more dangerous than being in construction. That's not the case where I'm from. 

Hopefully that'll clear up some miss understanding. If you have any questions ask away. 


I'm not going to mention what company I work for, or where I'm from. I just don't feel comfortable doing so. 

Cheers, have  a great (and hopefully safe) day.We weren't allowed to sit at my old job. Even though our job didn't require us to walk, or stand for any reason. We weren't allowed to sit because a worker in the past once pushed to chairs together and slept. My last manager (global company) tried to tell us that if she saw us at each other's desks discussing non- work related things, we had to keep track of those minutes and take them as vacation.

She didn't last long.You can finish ur work on time,you can log in and log out on time ...no one cares...the ones who get praise are people who work late and why do they work late because they can't finish the work on time....but its fine.. 



Bob is working late and taking up so much load for company... No! fuck you!....bob is working late because he can't fix a single line error for four fucking days..At the daycare where I used to work: 

1. Eat the same food as the kids during meal times to promote healthy habits and model good table manners.

2. Do not serve yourself until all of the children are served and have had as many servings as they'd like.

3. Do not eat when the children are not eating.

4. Do not eat unless the children are finished.

5. Meal times require staff to be actively serving the children and regulating behavior, they are not a staff lunch break.


So basically we have to eat their food, but can't eat their food, but can't pack a lunch because we aren't allowed to eat different food but we can't eat the prepared food (and there was no fixed menu so we could fudge similar enough food from home to "share") and we have to eat when they eat but we can't be eating while they're eating because we have to do our job and we can't take it in shifts because we have the minimum staff-to-child ratio in rooms at all times to avoid waste....

99% of us just ate whatever the fuck we wanted during nap time IF all the kids were asleep or the awake ones got soothed in shifts so we could eat. The other 1% didn't work over meals or just ate whatever.Supervisors aren't allowed to have any unnecessary contact with employees under them outside of work. This wouldn't be that idioti c if it weren't for the fact that the supervisors are just other teenagers that got conned into taking on a bunch more work for a .50 raise. My dad is a flight nurse. He has a flight suit that he carries anything he could possibly need while transporting a patient.  One day he came home all pissed off. "I carry all kinds of needles and drugs that can paralyze someone but they won't allow me to have my muli-tool on me because it has a knife blade over 3 inches long."   Our saftey protocol states that if there is a fire and there are wheelchair bound students or employees on the second floor, we are to leave them at the top of the stairs for the fire fighters and emergency personnel to help once they arrive :/

Sooo.... basically they get to burn to death.We couldn't back into parking spaces at my old job.I worked somewhere that had a separate code for different parts of the building. Quite a few got locked in the stairwell without knowingNot work, but at my school, we can be expelled for having a crayon in our pocket. Yes, you read that right. A [crayon.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjuqKOP4djMAhVR92MKHXkWBswQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dickblick.com%2Fproducts%2Fcrayola-large-size-crayons%2F&psig=AFQjCNElH0Audw9l6qgPkp7FOgsAdxzRhg&ust=1463287557733124)  It is spelled out specifically in the rules that one of the punishments for having a crayon on you is expulsion.

Edit: Some other choice rules:

No tuxedos (we already have a uniform)

No monocles

No top hats

No coconut bras

No wallet chainsCan't go anywhere unless we have another person to accompany us. Bathroom, store etc.Look busy. 

I fucking hate looking busy. I work in a small programming company. We haven't set up any kind of version control yet, so to avoid overwriting other people's changes to packages and scripts we have an item associated with each file. If you want to edit a file you need to go to the person with that item and ask if they're done editing the file. If yes you take the item so the next person has to ask you. Thing is these items are just whatever we had in the office at the time. 

Chart package is associated with a foot tall clay zombie gnome.

Filter package is a pair of 3d glasses (which some people insist on wearing when editing that file).

Those are the strangest two, we also have a few kinder egg toys and an empty bottle of Jack Daniels
Snowballs are banned for everyone now because some kid (customer) on a chairlift hit a skier in the balls with one.My boss insisted that everybody be at their desks at 8:30 sharp. She made me take roll on an attendance sheet and hand it into her everyday. She also made me do it at lunch time (when everybody left and came back) and when they left at night.

Took roll for a bunch of adults three times a day. I don't work there anymore.
No microwave popcorn. No post-it notes. Not my current job but, at my old chain restaurant job we weren't allowed to give cups with bottles of soda.  They had to purchase soft drink cups to have cups for their 2 liter and it was ridiculous Here goes. So I work in a warehouse/school that doubles as a program that employs mentally challenged people. It has a "scared straight" program for juvenile delinquents and we also take prisoners from a work release program. I am a "support worker" which means I am a normal, adult worker whos job is to keeps production afloat. For one, we can't have knives... In a warehouse... Where 90% of the jobs we do require a knife... Too many kids/prisoners/mentally ill people stabbing each other. We can't change the station to Oldies because the subject matter is "too suggestive". We can only talk about three subjects: sports, news, and the weather. If someone hugs you, protocol is to stand still - do not hug back, do not push away and wait for a teacher to pull the kid off of you. 

Here's some things us support workers have done and WEREN'T fired for: Doing heroin in the bathroom. Doing heroin in a car. Doing heroin in someone else's car and then doing the owner of the car in broad daylight when the special kids are around. Getting fingered by a married coworker outside of the office window and moaning loud enough for everyone to hear. Pulling 2 no call, no shows every week for a year (me). Showing up shitfaced drunk (sometimes me) Smoking a blunt in the front parking lot. Half the workers get stoned on lunch break and the supervisor is fine with it (the assistant supervisor joins in). Giving a kid a cigarette (me). Telling a kid to "step back a few feet cause I can smell the cock on your breath". Dating a high school kid. The list goes on.

Bonus story: we had a 300+ lb woman who wrote down hooker as her only past work experience on her application. She was hired, but left in the middle of her first day to see a John.Sister is a cheerleader for a professional sports team. They aren't allowed to talk to any of the players at all. If they have any interactions with them, they are fired immediately. Sucks cause I really want my sister to have Kevin Durant's babies.
We can't write our last names on the stuff we hand in at school because if a student knows another student's last name they can apparently find where they live.... well, we all know each other last namesI'm an airline pilot and I get my nail clippers confiscated by the TSA. 5 minutes later, I'm sitting in a cockpit with a literal crash axe behind my seat. When I was in the military, you weren't allowed to put your hands in your pockets.No hoodies. Jeans and tennis shoes are ok but hoodies is where they draw the line. Just seems silly for an office with almost no dress code to be adamant about their employees not wearing hoodies even if it's raining. Except on Friday. Friday hoodies are ok.We're only allowed to use the bathroom in the employee break area, at least a good three minute walk from my workstation, sometimes more if I'm a few floors up. I guess they're worried that a patron might be offended by pissing next to us? I don't know. Can't take lunch meals home. I totally have the right to decide when and where I put my food in my mouth. Total bullshit.No radios. They apparently attract mice.Everyone has to wear ear plugs....even the deaf guy.100% proofing policy for alcohol purchases. It's not really stupid - it is just more of a nuisance for customers and customers aren't afraid to let you know how they feel about being carded. But it isn't the stores rules or fault, we only have a restaurant liquor license so we are obligated to card every single person to basically cover our asses The customer is always rightWe're not allowed to hang our own pictures. We have to put a work order in.I'm a web developer and every single part of the job can be done from home, however we have to come into the office to work. I only have one meeting a week and its just a conference call. Myself and my boss are the only two people in the office on the Web team, the rest are in a city that's two states away, so it's not like I have to come into the office to collaborate with the team in person. Doesn't make sense, but I've only been there for a month so I can't really question it yet.Don't cross the streams really wish they would tell us why we can'tI'm not required to be at work on Fridays, but if i want to go out of town on a Friday i have to fill out a leave form and they will dock my pay.  
I'm salaried. We aren't allowed to drink water, we are cashiers at a grocery store and even on the summers hottest days we are expected to go ~3-4 hours without anything to drink. Now I'm a rebel, so I do it anyway because, it's necessary for survival n'shit and most of my supervisors won't give me flak. But it's still there, and certain people will make a big deal of it.I used to work at a company that was sponsored by Evian and we would have 3 massive fridges with free bottled water, that was restocked daily (and never ran out)

To make you drink it our company cut the taps in the kitchen sink so you had no other choice but to drink it. Fine, but then our boss decided that 1 bottle (330ml) was the new limit of how much free water you could have. Imagine working in the summer and being told you're not allowed to have any water. It was especially mean as it was free for the company.[hardware requirements] All laptops must have a camera and a microphone.

[security requirements] Laptops with cameras and microphones must have them disabled.Meghan Trainor. Her messages in her songs are awful at best, and I constantly wonder how she ever got famous.I have nothing against his acting, but Ron Perlman's head freaks me out, man. Nicki Minaj
Pitbull 

Why does Pitbull say his name at the beginning of every song? So you have time to change the radio station.Kim Kardashian.

For the obvious reasons, that shes a vapid, talentless waste of space, and the fact shes so popular and people are so interested in her says a lot of negative things about the society of which Im a part. Also, I want to fuck her really bad, and that causes an uncomfortable psychological conflict within me. 

I'm white though, so I'd never have a chance, anyway.James Corden. The carpool karaoke thing makes me angry. Vince Vaughn. In my opinion he's just not funny and very annoying.Laura Prepon. 
She ruins everything for me!would that mattyb kid count?Floyd Mayweather. Way too arrogant for my taste.Jenny McCarthy, because her advocacy for not vaccinating literally killed people.

Dr. Oz and Deepak Chopra, who have made careers out of peddling pseudoscience.

Ben Stein, who made "Expelled," to try to leverage religious ideas into schools.Ellen Degeneres Beyonce. Amy SchumerAside from the Kardashians, I can't stand Katie Price in the UK. She's so attention seeking with her appearance, airing her dirty laundry in public and using her kids for attention. And *that voice.* ugh.Buddy Valastro from Cake BossI can't stand James Franco and I just don't know why. His face just makes me annoyed Ted Cruz.

It has nothing to do with politics, I just can't stand to look at him and hear him talk. Jennifer Lawrence tries too damn hard to be likable. Anyone who tries that hard to be appear down to earth and relatable probably has a few bodies in their cellar. It's just not natural. Kathy Griffin Julia Roberts, pretty woman ruined her for me, I can't see her as any other character. Every time I see her in anything I think, ditzy former hooker. And it's all because she was so good as the ditzy New York hooker, she owned that role, and it ruined me ever seeing her as anything else. 
Jimmy Fallon. He is so bland and non controversial. It's like anytime an interview even has a half second to go somewhere he pulls it back to being as interesting as bread. I can't watch him, especially when he has amazingly talented actors working on the coolest projects, but just uses them to like throw footballs through windows so people can share the video on Facebook the next day. *kills self*Taylor swift. Bitch was amazingly rich before she began her career. I mean driving a lexus to your school and having a ranch with personal horses kind of rich. Her dad bought the record label which launched her ffs. But all we hear is how she struggled in this male dominant industry (by writing songs on ex-flames). But the good thing is she's fading away now and can make way for more shitty artists.Richard Kind. Plays same annoying character for everything and his face just bothers me.Jimmy Fallon just because he's a douche.

and for any Australian's in the comments, Waleed Aly. I think he's a smug prick that makes everything a political issue when there's no need for it. Charlie sheenAndy samberg. He has a severe case of Punchable face. Plus his humor is better suited for youtube type fame, yet here he is making movies and shit. That Pop star movie looks like complete garbage.Justin Bieber - Kim Kardashian - Ariane Grande - Miley Cyrus - anyone connected to those - etcetera - etceteraGeorge Clooney.....because he's funding Hillarys campaign.  Idiot lives in Italy, what should he care?!Donald Trump Megan Trainor. I'm getting old now and I'm really fucking sick of young chicks complaining in songs about how bad men are or how betrayed they feel that every man on the planet doesn't bow down to them. They have no fucking idea how awesome guys are. Guys are the shit! Nope, they won't fall madly in love with every woman and do her bidding. That's not how any of this works! 

Also, That bitch needs to slow her role and stay the fuck away from Motown. I heard some kids bop song that tried to name drop some actual musicians. I found out it was her. I know the artists are dead but I cringed for them.  Jesus christ. There's so many that I hate, impossible to pick just one. I get really irrationally angry when I see wil wheaton on tumblr.

it's such a stupid thing but seeing him makes me so angry??Jennifer Connelly. I just want her to stop. Just pack your eyebrows and go.Taylor SwiftSeth Rogen, Jonah Hill,  Jesse Eisenberg, Adam SandlerRihanna. I love and hate her. I feel like she's been putting on this whole "humble" act lately because she knows her albums aren't selling the way they used to and she's gotta play nice to remain relevant (when her albums eventually stop selling altogether).Kardashians 

It pisses me off when I see people going crazy over them.. LIKE WHY???? WTF DO THEY OFFER TO SOCIETY?? Fucking making fake drama with their stupid iPhonesStephen Fry, he's so superior but he's not actually that smart. If you are clever it's fine to act like it but he isn't; he's just very good at seeming clever to slightly less clever people.Will Ferrell.  I don't understand how people find him funny.I haven't really liked Reese Witherspoon since her little tirade with the cops a few years back.  I had never felt like she was that egotistical until then.James franco. He's not funny. He was funny in Pineapple express and that's literally it. He tries so hard to come off as a creative artist one minute and a comedian the next. It's annoying.I read through everyone that's been posted so far. 

I can't readily muster hatred for *any* of them, even the occasional person who is talentless and/or clueless among them. I do wonder how some of them could actually be celebrities, but there's no accounting for what people will take interest in.

I'm *indifferent* to many/most of the people mentioned -- I simply don't care about them. Their personal lives and their activities are of essentially no interest to me. I can't muster much hatred for people I don't care about. 

There are a few that I'm not indifferent to, either because I either enjoy some of or don't enjoy what they do career-wise, but in any case I don't hate them, either.

Drew Barrymore.  She has a gross looking neck and her acting is horrible. Guy Fieri and his train to Flavortown.Kevin Spacey. The guy has been busted and outed multiple times for groping strangers in steam baths and harassing underage dudes on film sets, yet he continues to work.Juliette Lewis. Every fucking time, she makes my blood boil. No clear reason why.

Maybe its because she broke a wedding singers heart... Megan Fox. Ariana GrandeKaty Perry. Demi Lovato Adam Sandler. 


He's a stupid bully. 

I can't think of any redeeming features he possesses. Nicolas cagethe fat bitch from the new ghostbustersSandra Bullock, I can't explain it but she's like nails on a chalkboard to me.Whitney Cummings

This bitch only exists to reinforce the stereotype that women can't be funny. Plus, her face looks like a pit bull's asshole.anna kendrickCameron Diaz, Jennifer Aniston Ben Stiller.  The only time I ever laughed at anything he did was the "Bomb on an airplane" scene from Meet the Parents.  Everything else he just plays the same character which I never found even remotely funny, and I think much of his success is because he surrounds himself with funny people.I'm afraid to die.for the little things. some of them are really dumb, but work really well. for example, "if i die now, i'll never see how the walking dead ends,"or "if i die now, i'll never be able to fulfill x promise"I have a dentist appointment next Tuesday and they charge a $25 cancellation fee.I have people who would be terribly hurt that I didn't. 

I don't really believe in an afterlife or religion, and Beetlejuice gave  me more of a reason not to kill myself than any religion. The thought of having to work as a civil servant is more terrifying that any hell that has been described to me. Right now, I'm high and I'm watching the bar fight in "The Trouble With Tribbles".  It's moments like this that make it all worthwhile.my family. I wouldve killed myself years ago if they were not around. Season 3 of Rick and MortyBecause I think life is like a long-running tv show. Sometimes there are shitty episodes, sometimes there are shitty seasons, there's some characters I love and some that I hate, and the story arc can get kind of convoluted at times. But in the end, I'm pretty invested in it and want to see where it goes. Having too much fun, and I can't be stopped. Because life can be good.I'm very competitive.Because Jerking off still feels good, video games are still fun, and food is still tasty.My kids. I could never leave them at the hands of their fuckwad father exclusively. All I want out of life is to NOT screw my kids up and if I killed myself, that would ensure that I would. I realize I'd be dead and wouldn't even know, but the alive-me just can't reconcile that. 

Also, if I died, my husband would never eat a real meal again in his life and I also really am not okay with that. I can't end it now, it's just starting to get good. Once I started pretending to be broke, a few of my clients started paying me on time.I don't have the energy to kill myself. If there was a passive way to commit suicide within a day, I would have already done it. I've thought about getting hit by a car but I don't want to ruin anyone else's life.A deteriorating survival instinct. That is a good question. I have not found the best wayI guess cause I'm too stubborn to just give up the ghost.  

Thanks, I really needed something cheery today. There's nothing better to do.RedditThis is a question I ask myself repeatedly and I never seem to be able to come up with a satisfactory answer. I just seem to plod on from one day to the next with nothing much changing.Why not!!!     

I mostly want to see if I can do the things I think I can't do.     
I also love learning, I try to see all the things I can learn. Nothing can take that knowledge away from you.        

Everybody dies, I know I'm going to die. Why wait for it or waste time thinking about it. I'll face it when it knocks on my door.      

Also, don't you want to witness how far our planet changes or evolves. How far advance do we get technology wise. If I had died 20 years ago I would've missed the iPhone and Netflix. I'm excited about the driverless car and using it in my old age when I'm a danger behind the wheel. My secret hope is to witness Star Trek world or invention of a Time Machine or travel to parallel universe.      

In the meantime I'll cross off one fear at a time from the list. Keep on smiling and look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel. There's a party waiting for you there. 
Because the other option is death, and I don't think I'm ready for that yet.Because I can't figure out a way to have a guaranteed quick, painless death that won't hurt anyone else or cause any suspicion that it was suicide.  I don't want my kids to know how shitty life really is and I also want them to be able to collect my life insurance.


waiting for robot sex slaves and extra-terrestrials (for sex).Because I've had so many close calls im starting to feel like I gotta be here for some reason...I actually don't know.I have a full box of chocolate truffles in my fridge and I've pre paid my optical Internet for a year.It's been said that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Of course sometimes the pain isn't temporary ( Chronic pain, terminal illness). We empathize with those who elect to end agonizing and inescapable ordeals. But so often, it IS temporary. The pain, unbearable as it feels will heal... It's just we can't always see that it will, because we haven't yet discovered our ability to overcome crisis. But overcoming crisis opens up unexpected perspectives. Crisis invites us to be more than we've been so far.i hate thinking about how it would effect my family, that is the only thing that keeps me going.Because I keep not dying in my sleep. I will be playing with the band of the Ceremonial Guard in Ottawa this summer.With my luck, dying will be even worse.Mate, it's because I've got shit to do. Fun shit to do. I've just been playing the new doom, currently listening to a podcast I like and later today I'm going to a mate's place to play The Witcher 3. I've known this guy since I was 9 years old. That"s 11 years of friendship I have with this fella, I love hanging with him. Next month, it's my mum's birthday. I love my mum, I'm gonna go see her because I love her and the rest of my family.

In two months, I'm gong on holiday with my friend from before and two other mates I've known for a decade. I am so fucking excited for this. Once that's over, I have university next sem to start studying again. I love my course and can't wait.

There is too much good shit going on for me to feel down, especially compared to the alternative. What? Am I just going to be dead? What's that gonna do, that's boring as shit. Not to mention the horror it'd cause to those close to me. Life's too fun to not be a part. In my experience anyway.I haven't won...yet.I don't believe in an afterlife.
When I'm dead, that's it. I'm gone.

Now take a look around. Just how amazing is it that life even exists at all? There are so many experiences to be had, so you should probably milk life while you can.PussyIt's not like I'm doing it by choice, but I'm not going to die just because I can. Because I'm still capable of doing things that make me feel happy and fulfilled.

When that ends, I'll be ready to go.Fuck, now that you mention it...I used to wonder what my purpose in life was.  I know now its to take part in the revolution thats happening.Because  my friend is awesome and she'd probably be pretty upset if I diedI don't know.  I wake up each day surprised to have woken up.  I go through it again, that not this again.  Always making plans - never following through.  

I have no reason to keep on living but I do, because I've no other choice.  I have things to do.  Then I can go.

That's all I have.Too chickenshit to take the leap. Because I won't be able to clean up the mess afterwards, and i refuse to risk failing with pills or something.I have nothing better to do.My mom would be totally devastated and I'm not afraid to disappoint her but I'm also not about to potentially ruin her life. Also I really like partying with my friends. Smoking weed, listening to music, playing videogames, even working for my dad make my life worth living. Dying is a guarantee to happen eventually., what happens tomorrow isn't. 

Because death's not much fun.My family needs me. What else are you going to do.  You'll have plenty of time to be not alive, and just this brief fleeting moment to be alive.  Just wait to see what happens next.Because I'm enjoying life.My husband--he's pretty great. I believe I have the right to die if, when, and how I choose, *unless* I've chosen to commit to share my life with someone else, which I now have. To top it off, we're now expecting a child, so the responsibility is that much larger.So many people that I haven't tormented yet.I want to see Donald Trump kick Hillary Clintons ass in the election in November.  After that, meh...There is so much to do on Runescape..For my sister'sI'm going to spend a lot more time dead than alive. I want to take advantage and enjoy as many of those alive days as possible. My kids.Because I haven't played the ffvii remake yetBecause last years depressed episode really sucked and now that life is enjoyable again i don't see the point in quitting anymore. 

If i would have went through with quitting i'd have missed out on the most awesome year of my life so far. I've got nothing better to doAt this point, I honestly have no idea.I don't know. I ask myself that question every day.There are a lot of things I'm fascinated about and curious of.Still in high school so I don't know what it's gonna be like afterwardsIf I'm dead, how am I going to play video games and eat pizza?Mostly out of habit really. I have no reason to stop living.Fear of pain and the darkness waiting.Because life kicks assBecause I've just started climbing out of a whole where sometimes I Concidered ending it all. And now I've got things to do, people to be friends with, people to probably harshly reject me when I ask them out. Because it's worth it.I want to finish my engineering degree and build stuff for the betterment of mankind.  Sounds corny but I want to be able to make things that help people! Willpower. Having the ability in the darkest moments of your life to say to yourself "Keep on trucking my friend". A little help from the outside is a blessing. But the moments that only count is when the only person who can give you that reason is yourself. "Keep on Trucking OP".I am my mother's only child. If I were to die it would destroy herBecause there are things I want to do.

I'll die eventually. It'll always be waiting for me. It's not like it's a limited-time offer that's likely to expire and be replaced by something else if I don't do it soon. 

I'd much rather kick around this planet for a while and explore it before adventuring on to whatever comes next. It can wait. Because maybe there really is a reason I'm here. Who knows. So far, pointless, but maybe one day I'll see it.I still have some hope that I'll get out of this depression/anxiety mood that has been pressuring me in the last 5 years as far as I remember. And that I'll eventually open my feelings to the girl I like one day. There was a terrifying point in my life  where I regularly and sincerely expected to not wake up. This went on every morning for about a month.
Eventually I just learned to live with being alive.I don't know. I like living?I have a few good memories of things that are important to me. I don't want to forget those things. Because life is a joke and I want to make a good punchline. why...Because Jerking off still feels good, video games are still fun, and food is still yummy.To see the future.  There's no other way.Just to see what happens.It's kinda a thing that just happens. I'm not afraid of death, but rather, welcome it. If it happens, it happens. I guess life and death both happen and it's a miracle we all aren't dead. I got an eternity to die, might as well stick around and wait for something cool to happen while I got the chance.waiting on dream of springBecause I hope it will get better than thisHave you smoked good weed then eat great curry slowly?? Do we need to hang out? Start with a cup of water, not juice or soda. Here, I'll join you and get one too. brb... ...and its gone, and I do feel better! Your turn! I love my son.Razors pain you;

Dorothy ParkerYolo.Overwatch comes out in 10 daysI imagine my life like a movie, I just really want to see what happens next.Because my mother and sister probably wouldn't recover That warm cat head that is up against my leg. We've still got a few good years left together. Because whenever I feel when I want to end my life, I would always think about my future dream job. Like dude, if you were like 15 and end your life just like that, you wouldn't be able to experience your life long desire to enjoy your dream job. I had suicidal thoughts recently because I was attracted to a guy in class(am a guy.) And he rejected me because I was too attached with him. Now, I had overcame my suicidal thoughts because of the support from my classmates and thus, having the confidence to keep on living again.


Edit: some grammatical errors.The pain has yet to overshadow the curiosity.Your right... CyaI am 53.  Based on family history it is likely I will live another 30 to 40 years if I can avoid being run over by a steam roller.  I have big plans to make major changes in the world in that time.  I also want to live long enough to see my son become a famous film maker and my grandson do amazing things with his life.  I keep on living because I have so much I want to accomplish.  

If you are feeling life isn't worth living,  look at how you can make life better for those around you.  Because even if all else fails in my life, I still get to look forward to seeing her again.I kinda think suicide would be an oppertunity wasted. Not even in an optimistic way, really. More like, what are the odds of being born in the first place? Sure, shit may suck now, but, who knows what may happen? Especially considering the odds of the shitty sperm that made me actually winning the race. I dunno. Im high.I was part of a pretty bad firework accident where I could have bleed out if I didn't get attention immediately. Now before that happened I had a plain white collar desk job. I was kinda bored with life and felt that if I was to die I'd be ok with it but I could never end it myself. 

Then on one unfortunate July 4th I tried to light a firework and throw it. Well it blew up in my hand. When that happened I had the most strongest urge I've ever had and that was to live through this. It was like no matter what I had to live and it was most powerful sensation I've ever felt. 

Once I healed I couldn't help but laugh at how I was before the accident. At this point I was just happy to live a day that didn't involve excruciating pain in my hand. I felt like I had taken everything for granted before that. Death terrifies me. The nothingness beyond it terrifies me. My life so far has produced nothing meaningful, but I want to prolong the black abyss for as long as humanly possible. Pokemon Sun and Moon, Persona 5, KH 3, New Sum 41 AlbumMy mother had a best friend for about 40 years. They were soulmate kind of best friends. I have no other family, no cousins, or aunt or uncles, so they are family. Two years ago, my "aunt" went missing. Police were called. Dogs, search parties, signs were put up. My mother was told to stay home, in case she showed up there. I was at their house, with the family, when a police officer walked in. They were in and out at this point. He just walked past me, and I got shivers. He went upstairs to son #2 and a few seconds later, I heard the sound. The sound of pain. Of someone's heart ripped out of their chest. Son #2 let them know that he was to be the first to hear if they found her. After 3 days and nights of searching, they found her, in the garage.  I wont go into details, but yes, She killed herself. I then, with my 2 sisters, had to drive to my mothers house, and tell her that her best friend was dead, and that she killed herself. 

I have PTSD form that. That was the worst moment in my life, and I have watched my father slowly die of lung cancer. But that moment, that sound of son #2 s pain hunts me more then anything. 

I am also suffering from severe depression.  A term called double depression. I also have extreme anxiety. I don't leave my house. I have have shock therapy, which is extremely unpleasant. I no longer care about living, but I can't make someone else feel that kind of pain. 

And yes, I am under the care of many doctors, and on many, many drugsI gotta know how one piece ends So many books left to read. And more are published every week. Because I love my family and I love God.  I'm also very happy to spread his kingdom in this world.   I also look forward to grandchildren. :)So I can pass the 2-year mark of my company's suicide clause in the life insurance plan. If there's suicide within 2 years of taking out the plan, it doesn't pay out. If I commit suicide past the 2 years, then my family will get the money. That, and I haven't completely planned out exactly where and how I'll do it, and I still need to finish the long letter because I'm not leaving family and friends and everyone else without a full explanation of exactly why I did it. All this will take a while, so that's why I'm bothering to still live, for now.Because it is worth it.  When you can take a step back and breathe, it is worth it.  Cause the alternative might be more boringDamn, for a moment I thought this was /r/nihilism

Why do I keep on living? I enjoy it. I enjoy my job and taking care of my dog. 

My hobbies, I could enjoy more, but hippies have always been less than super fulfilling for me. I don't want to die. Dank memesCats...cats are nice.because life and existence are preposterously beautiful.  not all the time, hell not even most of the time... life is fucking difficult.  but the difficult times help me realize/recognize the beautiful ones, and everything balances out.

Once you start working towards becoming the person you've always wanted to be life is actually just as good as you imaginedHonestly, I don't know anymore Because despite my own hypocrisy and the heavy weight of being associated with Christianity due to the vast expanse of pain associated with God, I do think the story of Christ Jesus is legit and I want to be good to others in the way a select few have been good to me.Muse -  Knights of CydoniaMetallica - Hit the Lights Tom SawyerMoney for Nothing by Dire Straits.Yeah, I'm pretty sure [Electric Eye by Judas Priest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1B_pZC8aWU) is the only real answerRide the lightning Carry on my wayward son - KansasAC/DC - Thunderstruck Guns N Roses - Welcome to the Jungle[Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne](https://youtu.be/RMR5zf1J1Hs)Johnny B GoodeI really love Red Hot Chili Peppers' Higher Ground intro.Time by Pink Floyd

I grew up in rural Oklahoma but when I moved away I realized how I picked up important worldview to me in my upbringing that I don't see in most places I've been.

For example, I now live in Washington DC, home of the Washington Redskins (an American football team). It's mind blowing to regularly be around something named after a derogatory term, a term that was rightly disdained where I grew up. I've heard plenty of defenders of the name who lack complete historical and cultural context of Native Americans.

They watch and watch, but outside of paltry mentions in songs of the sky, no one really writes about them, genuinely. It is not that we do not care, but we simply see it as another amalgam of disco and taxes. When we watch the sun, even as strangers, the whole world ignores us, so why would it focus on the individual?

Here is the problem: There is no point in not noticing them, but major news stories need to give more focus and attention. One should not even care if they are true or false, just talk about the strangers in the sun so we can experience the beauty of the natural world. See, we can walk and talk and even sneer at the sun but no one even writes books about us. Who watches the watchers? Who sees the seers?

It looks very bloody but the situation is very controlled. Finding my father's dead body.  It's heartbreaking to get a phone call from someone letting you know that a loved one has died, but something else entirely to have your last memories of that person coincide with a traumatic experience.  It has been almost two years since it happened, and not once since then have I been able to think of my father without also thinking about how he looked when I found him.  I find that I'm far less likely to think about my father now because of how those thoughts and images make me feel; I hate it because I miss him and genuinely *want* to remember him without having to be so cruelly reminded that he's not here anymore, but I'm starting to think that my memories of both him and the way he died are forever linked to one another.This is a great question and I'm interested in the answers!...the only answer I could give is...I don't know.

One time, when an elderly patient came everything was pretty normal. We administered him fentanyl, midazolam, a muscle relaxant and propofol. He went under general anaesthesia, pretty uneventful from both perspectives (surgeon and anaesthesiologist) until he was in the recovery area... He started telling the other patients  that he was not aware that we had a light-induced anaesthesia (by the way it doesn't exist in the real world). He was telling the story along the lines below:


- Wow!! They just cast a light onto me, and bam!! I was not feeling a thing, and after that I just woke up here


I never told him that he was wrong, but I had to bite my tongue to avoid cracking a chuckle in front of him. It made my day... His nave interpretation of the medical technology

Edit few typos and a pair of commasI had foot surgery recently and during recovery the nurse said, "You were very polite." This confused me greatly so I asked what she meant. Apparently some people curse at them during the procedure (not fully out). I still don't know what I said. "Which cellphone?"Flip-phones really gave a good tactile "SMACK" when closing to hang up on someone.Being able to have conversations with people who don't check their phone every 5 min.People only took pictures of special events, not every single minute of their lives. Now with camera-enabled smartphones, it's like having a never ending roll of film. People feel the need to document everything that happens. When you're at a concert and not see a sea of phone screens blocking the stage.  SnakeNo social media. That stuff is cancer Having a real keyboard. I still can't get used to the strokes and spell check / auto correct are horrible. I was really proficient with an LG Envy 2.Socializing. No one seems to like talking face-to-face anymoreRemembering things. Now I just google stuff on my phone.Having a phone that i could drop repeatedly without it breakingPeople would not take pictures of others without their consent. This has become widespread and frankly I'm sick of it. The ability to have a small camera on your smartphone has apparently stripped some of their humanity and respect for fellow human beings. Dropping hot steamers in peace without having to text my aunt.Batteries that lasted for 5 days.Arranging gatherings with friends by putting notes in everyone's mailboxes. And subsequently meeting by a big, shady tree. Smoking in Pubs.Having time for myself and not having 15 people worried about me if I don't answer their text, twitter dm, fb message, instagram tag within minutes. Being able to get up from bed without taking 30 or so minutes to check your notifications.Flip phones. I never got to have one, and now I can't anymore. T9.  Seriously I could type a text without looking at my phone once. That one-handed fling of the wrist to open a flip phone.  Especially if you were answering a call - no buttons, just a flip.

Also, no emails on the pooper...A good old fashioned beat off magazineI didn't used to feel so old fashioned when no one had smartphones. Now everyone has one and I still don't.I miss no pain in my neck and wristsIt was so much easier to subtly avoid people without texting. "Oh, you called? Sorry, I wasn't home."We took videos on camcorders to record for our memories now we take video to share instantly with others. Real damn keyboards, or should I say, I wish my phonr has a rwal dann ketboardllNot everyone texted as much.  Texts were something you used to send a quick note to someone like "Missing you" or "Call me when you can."  If someone wanted a conversation, they would fucking call you because they were holding a phone in their hand!  So much time SAVED because you didn't go through hours of texting, being interrupted every few minutes.I used to write notes on my hand as reminders all the time (poor memory).  Now, I just put an alarm in my phone with a note.finding addresses in unknown places, it was a good exploration feeling, now i just check it on google mapsLooking into the future and thinking that phones would just get smaller and smaller until they become just a chip you place in your ear.Communicating with people face to face. Emotion in conversations is lost when all our communication is done on our phones or computers.I remember watching some old Nickolodean shows and being shocked at all the damn flip phones they had. It's completely alien in a world where we can now solve an equation, play a game, take nude pictures, get into arguments with strangers on the Internet, and prank call people all on one device.Texting without looking at the phone. I was quite good at it and could have entire text based conversations in class with the phone under the desk. 

Also insane battery life. My Nokia 1100 could go a week without charging. Playing "Mary Hand a Little Lamb" using the phone digits while on the phone with a girl..........Man, I had so much game.Hanging up on someone used to be a lot more fun with flip phonesNot knowing something, and wondering what the answer was.

Sure...you could go to a library. But often times that wasn't possible. So you'd sit there and just wonder what the answer might be. You'd have to think about it for a while and possibly come up with an answer. 

You'd fall asleep wondering. Two things. First is the diversity. Phones came in all different colors and it was excellent. Now most phones are black or silver and yeah you can put a case on it, but I had a lilac purple phone and it was the best! 

Second is T9. I have Swype now but it will never be as good as T9 was, and T9 can't become a thing in most cases now because almost everything is exclusively touch screen :( RIPMine is tied specifically to the lack of identical smartphones. I didn't think much of it at the time, but I remember associating each of my close friends with the cell phones they had. 

Maroon blackberry on this guy, orange EnV on her, Chocolate on him, etc. 

It's insignificant, but it added a little more individuality and style to the whole phone thing. Now everyone's rocking near identical iPhones and that's gravy but it's just a little more bland in my personal opinion. The PSION (a PDA) had a really great keyboard, that you could actually type on :-(Having individual buttons you could feel on a cell phone.  I miss being able to text without ever pulling my phone out of my pocket in class.  Well that was before I became cripplingly depressed so probably happiness or the will to live.The bar questions and arguments. I feel we had more of an opportunity to do something significant about climate change at a lower cost than we currently can.

I tried to keep in line with the original 10 commandments, but some had to be adjusted. and I did take a few from the comments below for inspiration. edit: formattingSo, I know this is going to get buried, but here it goes.

When I was fifteen or sixteen, My father and I were camping in some nearby mountains. He was going through the divorce with my mom, and wanted some bonding time with me. Summer had just started, and I wasn't working or anything, so I was all for it. 

We hiked 8-9 miles in the middle of nowhere, up next to this beautiful mountain lake. We pitch our tent, go exploring, roast some marshmallows, you know, the kindof stuff you do when camping next to a lake.

We slept peacefully that night. In fact, it was almost to quiet. When you go camping in the woods in that area, you can usually hear crickets at night, or the occasional hoot of an owl or something. That night, there was absolutely nothing. Even the lake water seemed still. 

We didn't notice anything, (My dad and I are both pretty unobservant about things) at least at first. That day we decided to go hiking up even higher, to reach a local peak that was supposed to have great views.  It took us a few hours, and eventually my dad noticed something was off. He paused at one point and said "Listen to that" and I stopped, and realized finally that there was nothing. The wind wasn't blowing, birds weren't singing, even insects couldn't be heard. Something was just....off. 

He isn't a very superstitious person, but I think it kindof scared him. He had been in the military (and he doesn't talk about it, but I think he saw some shit) He decided we should go back to the lake, and book it out of there. 

We ran (five or six miles) to our campsite next to the lake.

Except that the lake was gone. It was completely dried up, as if it was just sucked up by a big straw. And in the center of the lake, we saw a sort of metal box, but it wasn't rusty or anything.

Something drew my father to the box. He just sort of zoned out, and walked down into the dried out lake bed. He opens up the box. I couldn't see what was in the box, but he seemed visibly shocked. I asked him "Dad. whats in there" and looks up at me, with an expression of horror and says "Its the Serious tag OP forgot"totally surprised to have not seen this yet (unless i missed it):  
rule 1: be attractive  
rule 2: don't be unattractiveOne would be to downvote anything you don't agree with, even if it is a pretty good argument.

I've never met anyone that's heard about it, and it's one of my favorite movies. Basically, it's a coming-of-age movie about an introverted boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is sent to stay with his supposedly rich great-uncles (played by Robert Duvall and Michael Caine) by his flaky mother who wants them to like him so they'll give him their money in their will. [Go](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0139239/) (1999). 

It's about a girl who works at a grocery store, she's completely broke and about to be evicted. Two guys show up and ask her if she can help them find some mdma for some rave party later that night. She sees this as an opportunity to get the cash she needs, so she agrees. And of course everything goes wrong. (Funny "oh shit what now" wrong, not Requiem For A Dream super dark wrong)

You see the same night from different characters' perspectives.Buckaroo Bonsai Across the 8th Dimension.Smiley Face. It stars Anna Faris as a stoner who devours her roommate's brownies not realizing they had pot in them too, and her entire day is spent trying to fix it while blitzed out of her skull and of course everything goes wrong. It's pretty good.God Bless America. It's a Bonnie-and-Clyde type movie where a middle-aged man and a teenage girl drive around the country killing reality TV stars and bigots."**The Man From Earth**"

A college professor, John Oldman, throws a going-away party for himself and invites all of his friends from the university. While there, he begins to tell a tale about being several thousand years old. The professor's colleagues debate and discuss the likelihood of such a thing being possible... and all the while, the story takes them further and further down the rabbit hole.

It's a remarkably good film, and it's perfect for anyone who enjoys a good story. 

There's even a second one waiting for people to discover it.

>During John's tale, he mentions that he's never seen conclusive evidence of other immortals existing. His statement is particularly ironic, considering that there's another one in the room with him. Sandy, the historian, interjects at one point, offering what could easily be mistaken for a whimsical speculation... but which is actually a memory. She also seems oddly sympathetic to the emotional trauma of outliving an adult child, almost as though she's had to endure it time and time again. Even when John tells Sandy - who had just confessed to being in love with him - that he can only spend ten years with her, she responds with knowing amusement rather than any kind of skepticism.

Now, to be fair, I've never gotten confirmation of this theory. I even wrote to the director about it, but didn't receive a response. In the context of the film's story, though, it makes a lot of sense, and it adds an element of depth to the whole thing that's visible but unrecognized... much like the character it includes.

Same kind of movie as Rounders. You'll recognize most of the people in it but have no idea who they are. Christopher Walken is in it, and he's awesome; Stephen Tyler's other hot daughter is too.[Skeleton Twins](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571249/)

It doesn't seem too well known, but it's one of my sister and I's favorites. Features Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig from SNL! Don't let that fool you, though. There are funny moments but it isn't really a comedy. It's pretty grim but has a totally feel-good ending.

It's on Hulu! GO WATCH IT!Shoot 'Em Up
I never heard anyone talk about this movie but Clive Owen was fucking awesome.The Leningrad Cowboys. It's basically a Finnish made spinal tap. I have never met anyone thats even heard of it though.Wristcutters: A Love Story.

I have some very bittersweet memories with this movie as it was the last thing my best friend and I did before he ended up killing himself, but there was something very tender about spending time with him watching it.*batteries not included (1986 I think?)

About these cute little drone/robot type things. They help this family in NYC, and idk I just always enjoyed it.[Sunshine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/)

It's a great movie that not that many seem to know about. The [sound track](https://youtu.be/ab3NscEJ80s?t=45) is amazing too.Dead Mans Shoes is a quality British revenge thrillerMeet the Feebles. A b-movie from 1989 by Peter Jackson. Pretty much The Muppets with drugs, sex, death, and lots of profanity... [and a song about sodomy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulb0pLBgRCw).Bit late to the party, but I've re-discovered my love for "*batteries not included" ever since it hit Netflix recently. Not sure if it's on anymore. End of Watch. It's got action, friendship, a love story, a good story, and some damn good acting. Plus, Anna Kendrick.Rad. Circa 1986Kiss Kiss Bang Bang! RDJ and Val Kilmer together and it's a noiry, spoofy genius film that I adore. 

Only met like 3 people who have seen it so yeah. Matinee. A 60-set comedy/drama from Joe Dante, in which John Goodman plays a schlocky B-horror director clearly modeled after the real life William Castle (Google him). So many movies set during this time period cast a fervent, nostalgic eye back, but this is one of the few ones that also addresses the darker side of this time period- namely, the Cold War. But it's a Hell of a lot of fun to watch, I always put it on when I'm feeling ill or blue. Song of the Sea. It's easily in my top 3 animated films of all time and imo it's *far* superior to the film that beat it for the Oscar (Big Hero 6, which was cute but largely forgettable). But nobody I've ever talked to about it has even heard of it  and that's just a shame. It's a beautiful film that I would recommend to anyone.

Watched this when recommended in a recent similar thread in /r/movies - if you like time travel and twists, you can do much worse. You'll probably pick up on the twist about 2/3 but it doesn't diminish the ending.There are a bunch of 80's and 90's movies that were on all the time but never took off. I've saved my VHS tapes because some of them didn't even make it to DVD. A few of them are:

- Shag
- Sing
- That Night 
- Staying Together 
- Book of Love 
- Teen Witch [Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYllBpl-9I)

 It's an awesome indie film about a girl who goes to MIT who drunk drives and ends up killing a musician's entire family, except for him. When she got out of prison, she worked for him as a house cleaner (he didn't know who she was). At the same time, there is a parallel story of a planet that appears very similar to ours moving closer and closer to Earth. I won't spoil anything, but for a sci-fi movie it is incredibly grounded and relatable. I highly recommend it. Lawnmower Man

Pretty decent movie.The Vikings (1958)[Brothers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765010/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) I don't know, maybe it's well known, but I've never talked to anyone who has seen it. Some of the scenes hurt bad, like really really bad.Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead.

You don't need to know anything about it except that it's your next favorite movieAngus. Funny movie with a great soundtrack. Although the story is the cheesy "uncool guy gets voted in as prom king joke but ends up owning it" plot, it has so many good parts. Fear of a black hat, watch it. Mockumentary of 90's rap musicLast tango in Paris, so far noone I know has heard of it, demographic issue maybe?I'm not sure if [LadyHawke](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089457/?ref_=nv_sr_1) fits into your definition of little-known, however I don't really know anyone to bring it up and it is dear to me but came out in 1985 so it has a lot of competition for being remembered.

Lars and the Real Girl[Bug](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277615/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_4)  
How the smallest actions can have very large effects.Anyone who doesn't speak Hindi or Urdu will most likely have never heard of this movie, although there may be a small minority who have.

3 Idiots. It's easy to relate to a lot of the themes and issues dealt with in this movie, and calls bs on things in academia, and makes you think twice about some stuff.

And it's hilarious too.

edit: not academia, i mean higher-education culture*[Gummo.](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0119237/) The whole movie is just a big wtf. I love showing it to people who have never seen it just to see their reaction.FDR: American Badass.

Come and See, Byalorussian, 1985. It's fucking disturbing and amazingly shot and with possibly questionable production ethics (they sometimes used real bullets in place of blanks).

Almost wore out the Blockbuster copy as a kid. 

Also, the House of Dies Drear - haven't seen it in 20 years, wonder  if it would still creep me out. Jean De Florette, it may be more well known that I assume, but I personally don't know a single person who has seen it...Switchblade Romance was also pretty good. Both are French films.I really enjoy The Sandlot and its sequel. Never really liked the third one though.

Fun little noir-ish movie with sharp dialogue, cool story and charismatic actors, not sure why it hasn't gained more traction than it has. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play reclusive rival mob bosses, and also Bruce Willis plays a character call Mr. Goodkat.Not sure if it's that unknown, but the King Arthur movie from 2004, with Clive Owen. I think most people regarded it as a giant shrug, but I thought it was great.

Last week I watched a doc on Netflix - The Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats its Young. Really awesome, you should try it.

Lake Mungo is also a pretty interesting movie, if you want a different spin on the horror genre.11:14. A dark comedy surrounding several groups of characters whose fates intertwine at 11:14 due to an unfortunate death.GattacaThe Room. It's the worst movie ever made but I get a kick out of watching really bad movies. Paired with the drinking game it's perfect. 5/7[Oscar](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0102603/). It's a comedy. 

I don't want to give too much away, so here's a really brief idea of what it's about. Sylvester Stallone plays a gangster during Prohibition/The Great Depression who promises his dying father that he will become legitimate. On the day he's going to invest his money in a bank and stop all criminal activity, he gets a visit from his one of his employees which sets off a chain of events in which everything falls apart. There are black bags, overzealous detectives, rival gangsters, elocution lessons, marriage proposals, and so much more! 

It's one of my favorite movies and hardly anyone seems to have heard of it.The Iron Giant. i haven't seen many people talk about it, so I assume it's not very well known. It's possibly the best animated movie ever made. [Love & Teleportation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306633/)Neverwas[Forgotten Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Silver)*Rid of Me*.

It's the same director from Prisoners/Sicario, and the movie is incredible.

A woman goes to a Pentecostal compound (snake handler church) looking for her sister. It's really good.The Auteur.
The worlds greatest porn director's life is in free fall.  He has lost his creative spark, his wife, his best friend, and the critics have savaged his latest movies ("two dicks DOWN!").  While attending a film festival devoted to his older films, he is forced to confront the wreckage he has left behind him and try and reconnect to the people who's friendship elevated his past work to greatness.
This was shot in Portland, Oregon just before the "Portlandia" era of hype and craziness.  I love that the 1st lines of the movie are "Why here Doris?  Why Portland Oregon?"  "I don't know sir, sometimes life just deals us a bad hand."   A great little movie that almost no one has heard of.  Tons of nudity, porno movie parodies, etc, but surprisingly sweet despite it being centered around the porn industry.  I bought a print on demand copy off of Amazon.   Think I'll watch it again right now.   Thanks for the idea Reddit. Unknown (the one with Jim Caviezel, not Liam Neeson)Barefoot (comedy)

Pretty fun watch, plus the animation's gorgeous. Music's awesome as well.The Wizard of Speed and Time.  It's about a indie filmmaker/animator/special effects wizard with the passion of Ed Wood (but some actual *talent* to back it up) trying to hit the big time in late-70's Hollywood.  It's definitely low-budget, and it knows it, but it does pretty well with what it has, plus the guy's short films are really neat.I saw a movie, I am David, and liked it.  Best part is that it introduced me to the music of Damien Rice - best gift a movie can give.  I'll always be grateful for seeing that movie.My favorite Disney movie has always been The Black Cauldron. 

Unfortunately it's also known as the movie that almost killed Disney because it flopped so hard. Chan Is Missing

It's such a neat little portrait of Chinese-American life in the mid-80's.The Gamers 2:  Dorkness Rising

Skip the first Gamers movie, because it's so low-budget to be cringe-worthy.  Gamers 2 is still very low budget, but much better than the first.  It's about some D&D gamers, going back and forth between their real life struggles and the quest they're gaming to win in their campaign, with the actors playing both the players and their characters.  Lots of laughs!'Love Me If You Dare' (2003); it gives me tingles. The Kings of Summer.

Wherever possible, ensure all parties that will be affected by an action that you take are informed, consenting, and able to consent. 

Seek to do no harm; where that's not possible, seek to do the least amount of total harm. 

Seek an equilibrium, in all aspects of life.

Seek to know everything.
Constantly second guess your knowledge; question, test, and strive to perfect it.

Judge a person's actions based on their intentions and understanding of the situation at the time the situation arose.

Acknowledge that you are not infallible, accept when you are wrong, and make changes to any current practices implemented and affected by a falsity. 

Seek to resolve disputes with reason, not force, for force only dictates who is stronger, not who is right.

Forgive, don't forget. 

You are responsible for your actions and their effects.

Know the difference between belief and knowledge; act accordingly.

Do not lie. Actions based on lies do not encourage growth. 

Do not suppress truth.

If a practice makes more logical and reasonable sense than your current one; adopt it.

YOUR MOM

http://i.imgur.com/3aaVRSp.gifI told this racy joke:

A rooster is so horny he does all the chickens in the hen house until they're too exhausted to go on. Then, the rooster goes after all the barnyard animals - barn cats, sheepdogs, field mice, goats, pigs, horses and cows. After all of that, the farmer comes out and sees the rooster lying in the dirt, barely breathing, buzzards circling overhead. He falls to his knees by the rooster, wailing and crying out, "My poor rooster! He was such a good rooster!" 

The rooster opens one eye and, pointing upwards, says, "Shhhhh! The buzzards!"

I told this joke as an eight year old...girl. It's been several decades but my brain still likes to conjure it up when I'm trying to sleep. WTF was my dad thinking when he told that in front of me?I used to ride around on my bike with a Donald Duck boom box  while blasting the soundtrack to Cats. 

I once referred to a miscarriage as a dud... in front of the parents... up until recently I had some hope they didn't remember but... but yeah... *yeah they do...*I lost a spelling bee when I was 7 because I spelled diamond without the a. I was so embarrassed because I was one of the smartest kids in my class, so I told everyone, including my mom, that I thought they meant the *other* diamond. The one spelled like dimond. YeahhhhIt's been suppressed from my memory I thought stripes looked good with plaid. I called one of my friends "Niglet" not knowing it was a bit racist. His real name was Nigel, and he was black. For some reason, I heard his parents calling him Niglet so that's what I called him.

His parents overheard me and assumed I was a little ol' racist. I wish the fucker would have corrected me at least once.

When I was 7 I said the N word when my family was playing the animal letter game in a restaurant. Didn't realize that I said anything wrong and when they tried to get me to shut up I just started saying the word louder. There was a black family in the next booth. When I read this a repressed memory of 4 year old me telling my cousin I wanted to marry her because she was pretty just resurfaced. Feels bad man.**Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*I went back to full on omnivorous diet due to lack of time with meal planning, personal health and other lifestyle changes (was going through some rough relationship stuff). Looking back on the experience, I don't think I could go back to being vegan, and the farthest I have entertained the thought is pescetarian.
Edit: My body handled the change with no issues, i Eased into it, starting with adding fish back in then meat. I was vegan for a year and a half. My body honestly feels better now, but that's just me. I was initially vegan for a combination of health and morals These days i am just incredibly thankful for the food i eat and try my best to support moral conscious animal products( if that makes sense)I was vegetarian for a year, and I quit because of a single meatball. Eating that meatball was the best decision of my life .I was vegetarian for 4 years and vegan for 2. My body was the healthiest it ever was when I was vegan. I did it for ethical reasons but slowly, went back to eating meat and dairy because it was hard to maintain when everyone around me was an omnivore. It's just a lot easier when there are other vegans around you. But recently I've decided to go back to being vegan because I feel that my health is declining and I felt the best when I was vegan.  I feel awful after I eat meat and dairy. I've also realized that the ethical reasons for being vegan has always been very important to me so I want to stick to what I believe in.I went back to vegetarianism because it's honestly just easier than full veganism. I did go back to eating meat for a little while, but it gave me horrible, cystic acne, so I went back vegetarian (I still don't drink milk or eat yogurt or butter but I eat eggs maybe once per month or so and I can't stay away from cheese). I can't speak for myself, but one time in 2002 I was at a Tom Petty concert with a vegetarian friend of mine. We got stoned and met a guy named Snake Eyes who was grilling burgers. How could she resist? From that day forward, she ate meat again. [deleted]I was vegetarian for about 6 years. I just got tired of the lifestyle, I didn't really have solid reasons anymore for maintaining it, and I was curious to try meat again. I don't regret going back to eating meat.I was vegan for almost six years.  I had a heart attack and started eating salmon twice a week as recommended.  Other than that my diet is still plant based.I feel different-good now.  I went back to meat and dairy when I started eating low-carb in order to lose weight.  Losing weight helped me feel better, plus low carb's other benefits.Not a vegan but I was vegetarian for almost a decade (I was like 9 when I started on a whim) and I don't actually think anyone noticed tbh, one day at work my boss offered me a ham and cheese sandwich she had already made for me and I didn't want to be rude so I said thanks and ate meat from that moment on My sister went vegan for several years and even got a large vegan tattoo.  She's since got that covered and admitted it was just too much work.  I've told her I think she actually got more sick of saying she was a vegan than everyone else who kept hearing it.My family was vegan up till my early teens. My sisters and I just could not keep our iron levels up (predisposed to heavy menstruation plus African heritage) and it got the the point where we were getting very anemic. Supplements made us nauseous and constantly repeated on us so our parents stopped trying to push it and allowed meat products back in the house. Now I eat meat sparingly, but only because it's expensive and I never learned how to cook it as well.Most of space is just... space. For scale, [here is how big the solar system is if we represent the Moon as one pixel.](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)Betelgeuse, the reddish star in Orion's shoulder, is one of the [largest single objects visible to the naked eye.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Comparison_of_planets_and_stars_%28sheet_by_sheet%29_%28Apr_2015_update%29.png/1920px-Comparison_of_planets_and_stars_%28sheet_by_sheet%29_%28Apr_2015_update%29.png)Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned
A sun that is the source of all our power

The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
Are moving at a million miles a day
In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour
Of the galaxy we call the 'milky way'

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars
It's a hundred thousand light years side to side
It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick
But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide

We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point
We go 'round every two hundred million years
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe

The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
In all of the directions it can whizz
As fast as it can go, the speed of light, you know
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is

So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure
How amazingly unlikely is your birth
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth[Neutron Stars](http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/pulsars1.html).  After the supernova as the star collapses the pressure reaches a point were every proton fusses with an electron, turning it into a neutron until all that's left is essentially a single atomic nucleus 12 miles across weighing more than 1.5 times the mass of our sun.It was just so crazy to me, when I came upon the term "observable universe". We can see stuff that is so far that the light, quite literally the fastest thing, took 13 billion years to reach us, and it turns out their maybe stuff much beyond that, but not enough time has passed for it to reach us. Again, 13 billion years and their is still stuff so far, that it isn't yet visible because light from their hasn't reached us. That is just crazy. Space is so big, when calling it literally unimaginable doesn't seem like a wrong statement, and calling space as big, seems like the understatement of the observable universe.  
Also, u/andromeda321 has made space doesn't seem so big and so far and incredibly more wonderful, and for that I'd like to thank and honour her.More a theory, but the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) is something that I really find fascinating. It basically attempts to rationalise the existence (or non-existence) of other extra-terrestrial species and why he have, so far, found no evidence of them in our observable universe. 

Some great links on the topic:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI (Part 2)Here's an amazing earthly fact to break the trend for just a second:

SINCE there are more molecules of gas in 1 lungful of air than there are lungfuls of air in the earth's atmosphere... every time you take in a breath of air, the chance is greater than 50% that you just breathed in a molecule of gas that Albert Einstein exhaled in his last breath of life. Obviously, the same goes for any (and every) person in history, whether famous or not.Because the universe is expanding, eventually all other local groups will be so far away we won't be able to detect them at all.  Not so much a fact but a shower-thought: An alien race thousands of light years away studying  our planet thousands of years in the future would be seeing the Earth as it is today. Universe is big yo.The sun and moon are positioned perfectly, relative to the Earth, for solar eclipses to occur. The distance from us to the sun combined with the distance of the moon to the Earth means that they appear almost the same size in the sky, even though it's a total coincidence. If humans are around in millions of years once the moon's orbit has drifted enough that total eclipses are no longer possible, this will be one of the things that will make people think "I wish I was alive back then."In space no one can hear you screamSpaghettificationThat after a star has gone through its various elemental nuclear fuels, each stage taking multiple millions of years, once it get to the stage where Iron is being made, that last phase lasts for mere SECONDS before a (super?)nova is initiated.The iron in your blood, the potassium in your bones, and all the other elements that make you possible, were created inside a dying star.One of Neptune's moons has freaking [ice volcanoes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryovolcano).It's turtles all the way down.  The furthest humans have ever traveled from Earth was when Apollo 13 went around the dark side of the Moon.  When the mission went wrong and they slungshot themselves around the moon their orbit was 254km above the surface of the Moon and 400,171km from Earth.

Its the most isolated humans have ever been.It is predicted that in the far future, space will accelerate in expansion so fast that even light won't be able to keep upEverything in our galaxy is orbiting around a supermassive black hole.[Black holes can collide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhbMpe17fzA), and send out ripples in spacetime you [can actually listen to](http://mashable.com/2016/02/12/black-hole-merger-gravitational-waves-ligo-video/#hIgau.ICWEqz) By taking advantage of the space time continuum, it is possible to travel forward in time by getting really close to a black hole. The gravity of the black hole is so great that time is "slower" near it. So if a person from Earth hung out by a black hole, time would move slower there, but continue to move at the same speed on earth. So when they return to earth, they will have essentially traveled forward in time. That there are Blackholes Millions and even Billions of times the Mass of our Sun blows my mind. Honestly, Blackholes that are even 2x the Mass of our Sun is incredible. That we live in a very uniqe time when we can deduce the future of the universe and we can also see what happened in the past.There's a kind of egg-shaped planet in the Solar System, out beyond Pluto. It's shaped that way because it spins so rapidly that its "day" is under four Earth hours long.

I like to think of it as the real life Good Egg Galaxy.The Cosmic Microwave Background, considered to be a leftover remnant of the big bang, is around 3K, -270C or -454F.There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth.If you put the universe in a tube, it would be a very long tube.There are more trees on Earth than stars in the galaxy; Stars are a much rarer occurrence than the internet may lead you to believe.Everyone talks about the Sun dying in 5-10 billion years, but we should be much more worried about the Moon falling out of orbit in 1-2 billion years.The density of a supermassive black hole cash be less than that of waterCtrl-F "Astronomer here!"

Paging /u/Andromeda321


Edit: To add an actual fact, if we had a different number of dimensions in the universe, things don't work out anywhere near as nicelyThat if the sun had the same mass as an average human, humans would output more heatHave you actually seen an image of the Moon at a non-full phase through a telescope with your own eyes? It looks far, far clearer than any photograph or illustration in a book or website.

Given how much more amazing the Moon is when viewed with the telescopically aided eye when compared to a photograph, one wonders just how incredible Mars or Jupiter might look up close.All of the planets in our solar system can fit between the Earth and the Moon!
I am just waiting for the day when some one posts here that there is a planet 10 in the solar system. In billions of years, the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way will collide.The largest known black hole has a radius of 1600 [Astronomical Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit) and its mass is 40 billion times greater than that of our sun, meaning it is roughly four times as massive as the entire [Large Magellanic Cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Magellanic_Cloud).
if you took a spaceship, flew around the earth 99.99% the speed of light for 6 months, when you came back everyone would see you as 24 years older than when you left!We are composed of the same atoms that make up the entire universe. The earth is getting fatter, not because of soda and chips, but because the universe is so full of garbage and debris that about 80,000 pounds of shit fall on out planet every year.

Thank you for not littering, Universe.Kepler-70b was once inside its parent star.One in four Americans are not aware that the Earth rotates around the Sun, according to the National Science Foundation.  Space isn't actually a void, they just tell you that because it's complicated. On a plank level particles are constantly creating and destroying each other. It's just so minuet that it's not of consequence to you unless your working on string theory or other such completely.   That the super shenron from dragon ball super is bigger than hundreds of galaxy's combined.

I became a hobby astronomer when I found this [picture of the north pole of Saturn](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/PIA18274-Saturn-NorthPolarHexagon-Cassini-20140402.jpg) and I was mesmerized that there was something as beautiful as this out there. How many previous generations have passed without knowing even about the planet? How many living people don't know about this? The Star VY Canis Majoris. Even with the Scale Size Comparison Videos its so hard to even fathom its size. It makes out Sun look like an ant compared to it. [Nightmare fuel for you](https://youtu.be/QgNDao7m41M)Some planets, possibly including Pluto, have ice volcanoes.Originally it was ashamed the closest star to us was 100x times the distance between Saturn and the Sun, where in reality it is 1000000x's more[if you have time, listen to radiolab's "Dark Side of the Earth." ](http://www.radiolab.org/story/242184-dark-side-earth/) real interesting stuff. Tommy Lee Jones is STILL on the moon Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.The fact that we are all made of star stuff is astonishing to me.

I really like this quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson on the topic:
"When I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us. When I reflect on that fact, I look up- many people feel small because they're small and the universe is big- but I feel big, because my atoms came from those stars."I forgot which planet it was, I think Neptune maybe, it rains diamonds Magnetars, neutron stars that create some of the strongest magnetic fields in the entire known universe, can turn atoms from their basically spherical selves into elongated rods from vast distances. Modern chemistry would be meaningless if you're sitting next to one of these things, although you'd have the iron ripped out your blood before you had time to ponder that fact.        
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagnetarThe answer is 42.The universe is like, at least 16 cubits wide by 30 cubits long.

Also that it's apparently actually beige. How did people figure that out?Neptune would float in water.Got stacks of facts 

 It's all relative 
 the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate
 we are discovering thousands of planets a year
 galaxies orbit too fast considering the observable mass in them, suggesting "dark matter," an unseeable (so far) form of matter that we currently give credit to for the unusual rotation curve of stars. 
 If you could travel at a speed close to the speed of light, you could travel the the star vega round trip in four years, but come back 50 years later.I remember watching a video where it said if an object was to be sucked in a black hole it would appear that it's lingering there and slowly get sucked in over time. Of course the object would disappear instantly but this is because of how light travels.that there are some stars that have "burnt out" but the light is taking so long to reach us that we don't know yetVoyager 1, the first man made object to leave our solar system, won't be closer to another Sun than ours in more than 39,000 years.Eventually even the other galaxies in our own local group will move so far away from us that we will not longer be able to see or detect them. If humanity still exists several billion years in the future, they will think Milkomeda is the only galaxy in the universe. There will be a time when the probes we have sent out to space will be the last remnant of humanity.Time will end in 5 billion years.

Not sure how, I read it once and it only talks about multiverses and probability.If somebody was looking at earth from 70 million lightyears away (give or take) they would see the dinosaurs. Not sure if you'd call this a fact but there was show on Netflix called the universe. On the show it said to imagine a period on a piece on a piece of paper in the US. That period represents the Earth in the universe. Kinda crazy to see how small we are compared to everythingSpace and time affect eachotherOur local group is a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. And because the universe is expanding, we'll never be able to reach outside of our local group.OP's mom is still bigger.Dark matter doesn't clump. That fucks with my head more than a rubics cube. Compared with Dark Matter, Dark Energy is boring. It doesn't go anywhere like DM does.That we will all succumb to entropy and nothing will be remembered.That in only 4 centuries mankind has went from thinking Earth is the center of the universe to understanding our very small place in the cosmos.  Rather than being scary it opens the possibilities of endless frontiers...That we can technically see through objects via Gravitational Lensing.

Binary black holes exist and are what caused the discovery of gravitational waves AND both of those black holes are believed to come fom a single parent star.

In a few trillion years - if the universe starts expanding faster than the speed of light - than objects in space will be moving away from us faster than light can reach us so space will appear to be empty.Black holes are literally made of nothing (the singularity is not part of the universe, so it doesn't count). Their mass is entirely due to the energy of the curvature of spacetime, and yet they are the heaviest single objects in the universe."[Your worst enemy] died horribly last night in a flaming car wreck""You don't have to come into work today."I can pm you avacado picsYou are *not* the father.Why yes, I'd *love* to go out with you.James BaxterAre are perfect and I'm so glad you are in my life http://www.refinery29.com/2015/12/98784/photographer-calls-strangers-beautifulYou look beautiful / handsome today.

The competitors in turn would spend billions developing wearables that Steve Jobs would knew no one would buy, resulting in the competitors financially ruining themselves. Hence the years of rumors about a watch that never materialized. 

However, with Steve Job's death, Apple scrambled to find new ideas... Finding none, they then picked up the Apple Watch project for real... Donald Trump is working for Hillary Clinton to sabotage the Republican Party from within and help her get elected.  
Every time Hillary does something embarrassing, there's Trump doing or saying something horrific and alienating another batch of voters. Thus distracting the media.   
If you were working to actively lose an election it might look like something Trump is doing.  "Convinced" is an overstatement, but the fact that Richard Nixon became President after RFK's death; likely would not have had he lived;  and went on to become the most treacherous, evil, conspiratorial piece of shit in White House history (Dick Cheney was merely a disciple of his); nags at my thinking on the subject.

There's no evidence, but...that's one hell of a guy being in place to benefit from something like that.Michael Jackson was innocent.

His father was a monster who realized that when his son went through puberty, his voice would change and the gravy train would end.

Unscrupulous producers connected him with unscrupulous doctors and he had Michael castrated. 

Michael suffered trauma and had his emotional development stunted.
He continued to identify with 10 year old boys. They were his friends.  
He spent his money like a child would. 
He resented his father and, through surgery, attempted to emulate his new authority figures - probably his therapists that helped him through that emotional time.  He had a lot of surgery. 

He married Lisa Marie so for legal reasons when he purchased the rights to the King's music.

When he did have children, they strongly resemble post-op Michael, not genetic Michael.

His castration, of course was the great shame of his life. He confided the truth to some of his close friends. They told their unscrupulous parents who then accused him of pedophilia. Michael paid hush money to keep the secret.

The premise of funny games is that a family gets tortured while the torturers keep breaking the fourth wall and judging you for the fact that you can essentially stop it at any time by turning off the movie, it's only due to your own morbid curiosity that these things are happening.

500 Days of Summer - there are a lot of great songs throughout the movie, but Regina Spektor's Hero during the [Expectations Vs. Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-xJ15AN9ts) scene is what really captured me.  The whole movie is about unrequited love.  I believe most of us have probably experienced that at some point in our life.  I watched it after spending a summer with a girl that I thought was going to be 'The One' for the rest of my life.  Unfortunately to her it was just a fling.

I guess that means I have some personal emotional investment in the movie and soundtrack.  You will probably not feel the same, powerful feelings I have while listening to it, but I thought I would share it all the same.

Her father thought that when she was a toddler she was retarded. He was ashamed by this and tied her to a bed frame until she was 13 years old.

Since she never had any social interaction, she never learned language. An examination of her brain showed that due to her social deprivation, she never developed the normal amount of ridges on her brain. Instead, her brain was more smooth.

We learned from her more about the "critical period" for language development, that if a child is not exposed to language soon enough, it will never happen even if they are taught later on in life.Dunno about historically, but there's this lady I know. She was raised in an abusive family--verbally, physically, sexually, the works. She eventually ran away as a teenager and promised herself not to get involved in the cycle of abuse and really make something of herself. Got educated, met a guy, fell in love. They had two kids.

Husband died of a heart attack when the oldest kid was 6. She did the single mother thing successfully for many years, then bam--the daughter was diagnosed with cancer in her early twenties. They struggle together to fight it but the daughter dies about three years later. Less than a year after that, the son commits suicide.

This woman is completely, utterly alone in the world. She had a few brief years of happiness and the rest of it has just been hell. Every relationship has ended in suffering. I genuinely expected her to commit suicide after her son did but she's still here. I don't know how you come back from burying your husband and both children.Really the saddest stories are those that never get told. There are thousands of people throughout history who we will never know because history failed to recognize them. That is the saddest story to me[deleted]I once read about a young Austrian boy, raised in an abusive home, ridiculed by all around him, whose only dream was to become an artist. An animal lover and a vegetarian, he saw the purity of nature and the vile barbarians that man had become. All he wanted to do was to raise up the best in his fellow man and to show them what it means to be pure again through his art. Sadly despite all his struggles, his passion and even being injured in a war serving his homeland, this tortured artist was denied the possibility to follow his dreams. Truly tragic.Vincent Van Gogh 
His whole life he desperately tried to squeeze beauty and art out of himself, he tried to be a man of God, a missionary, sleeping on the street amongst the poor. They considered him more crazy than themselves, and the church rejected him. He never could support himself, even in the best of times, and every month his brother Theo sent him an allowance to live on. Desperate for love he bonded with a whore who had a little boy he tried to father, but his family, constantly disapproving, broke up the odd couple, ending the self proclaimed "only time light lit up my eyes". She died after drowning herself in 3 foot shallows. His mother consisted him stupid for pursuing paining, and after his death, it was discovered she burnt every painting and letter, as she might as well have lit her own son on fire. Vincent's father loved him, but was not hiding his sadness that was caused by his oldest son being supported by the youngest, spending his days with prostitures and paint, rarely stopping to eat; which lead to severe malnutrition. In and out of hospitals and sanitariums, staying with other famous painters until one by one they could not withstand the manic sort of passion that often is seen as anger. But despite all this, eventually his art began to be noticed in minor journals, and he sold one painting. These things would mean nearly nothing to most painters, but to Vincent, who had almost accepted his fate of failure, these things may as well have been signs from God. A day later he lay dead on his bed, his brother Theo by his side, a gunshot wound in the gut, a painful death. This man would never know the countless people who saw how he made such beauty in the use of his pain, how many would be inspired, how art teachers decades later would speak of him as a long lost brother. But he would never know, all he experiences was pain. His last words were "The sadness will never end.""I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men."

However, most people dont know that on the very same day a far worse fire occurred, in Peshtigo, Wisconsin. The October 8, 1871, Peshtigo Fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, is the conflagration that caused the most deaths by fire in United States history. On the same day as the Peshtigo and Chicago fires, the cities of Holland and Manistee, Michigan, across Lake Michigan, also burned, and the same fate befell Port Huron at the southern end of Lake Huron. By the time it was over, 1,875 square miles of forest had been consumed and twelve communities were destroyed. Between 1,200 and 2,500 people are thought to have lost their lives. The fire was so intense it jumped several miles over the waters of Green Bay, and burned parts of the Door Peninsula, as well as jumping the Peshtigo River itself to burn on both sides of the inlet town. Surviving witnesses reported that the firestorm generated a tornado that threw rail cars and houses into the air. Many of the survivors of the firestorm escaped the flames by immersing themselves in the Peshtigo River, wells, or other nearby bodies of water. Some drowned while others succumbed to hypothermia in the frigid river. 6
Gil Eanes
Passing The Point of No Return
Portugal Gil EanesThe name of Gil Eannes is hardly a household word; nor is that of the place associated with the Portuguese explorer, Cape Bojador. Nor indeed did Cannes discover the cape: the place had been known for many years. To journeyers of Cannes's time, Bojador represented an unbreachable barrier, a point of no return, and it was the achievement of this reluctant hero to pass that invisible boundary, in 1434. In so doing, he opened new territory, not only on land but in the mind, and thus made possible the golden age of Portuguese exploration, with all its glories and horrors.At that time, conventional wisdom maintained that the Sun was boiling hot at the Equator. Thus, even if a ship could get past Cape Bojador, the equatorial Sun would eventually burn it to powder. Furthermore, should a vessel somehow make it past all other hazards, its crew would most surely meet unspeakable monsters in the sub-equatorial region known as the Antipodes? By having the courage to risk his life (consequently opening up new worlds,) Eanes was effectively behind the European age of discoveries to come. He was, however, also in part to blame for what would become a thriving trade in slaves for centuries after.5
Joseph Warren
Father of the Revolution
Warren285Joseph Warren (1741-1775 AD) was regarded by many in his time as the true architect of the American Revolution. He was the key figure in one of the historys most famous tea parties. He wrote a set of Resolves that served as the blueprint for the first autonomous American government. He delivered a speech that sparked the first battles of the Revolutionary War. He sent Paul Revere out on one of the historys most famous rides. He was the only Patriot leader, prior to the Declaration of Independence, to risk his life against the British on the Battlefield (Sandler 55). And, remarkably, he has been largely lost to history. He was surrounded by names we are all familiar with, and yet his own name is barely ever heard these days. Interestingly, his brother went on to found Harvard Medical School, and fourteen US States have a Warren County named after him.4
George de La Tour
Forgotten Master
473Px-Magdalen With The Smoking Flame C1640 Georges De La TourGeorges de La Tour (March 13, 1593, Vic-sure-Seville, Moselle  January 30, 1652, Lunville) was a painter, who spent most of his working life in the Duchy of Lorraine, (which was absorbed into France between 1641 and 1648,) during his lifetime. He painted mostly religious scenes lit by candlelight. After centuries of posthumous obscurity, during the 20th century, he became one of the most highly regarded of French 17th-century Baroque artists. In his lifetime, he was known as the Painter to the King (of France) and was regarded as one of the greatest artists. Very little of his work survives and the reason for his obscurity is unknown, but thanks to the efforts of Hermann Voss, a German scholar, in 1915 his work was rediscovered.3
Exercise Tiger
Testing D-Day
765Px-Plaque Commemorating Those Killed In Operation Tiger CropExercise Tiger, or Operation Tiger, were the code names for a full-scale rehearsal in 1944 for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. During the exercise, an Allied convoy was attacked, resulting in the deaths of 749 American servicemen. The lack of widespread knowledge of this exercise was due to intentional efforts (unlike most others on this list). As a result of official embarrassment and concerns over possible leaks just prior to the real invasion, all survivors were sworn to secrecy by their superiors. Ten missing officers involved in the exercise had Bigotlevel clearance for D-Day, meaning that they knew the invasion plans and could have compromised the invasion should they have been captured alive. As a result, the invasion was nearly called off until the bodies of all ten victims were found.With little or no support, from the American or British armed forces, for any venture to recover remains or dedicate a memorial to the incident, Devon resident, and civilian Ken Small took on the task of seeking to commemorate the event, after discovering evidence of the aftermath washed up on the shore while beachcombing in the early 1970s.2
Americas First Subway
New Yorks Secret Subway
Beach-Pneumatic-TrainIn 1904, New Yorks modern subway system was officially opened  changing the city forever. But what most people dont know is that it was not the first subway. Because of terrible congestion on Broadway, Alfred Ely Beach (the young owner of the fledgling magazine Scientific American) conceived of an idea  to build an underground railway, which used a giant fan to propel and suck a railcar back and forth through a tunnel. Because of the corruption of the commissioner of public works, William Tweed, Beach had to get consent to build his tunnel by pretending it was to be a mail delivery system. Tweed (whose income was derived largely from city transportation) did not veto the request.Beach and a small group of men began digging a tunnel under Broadway in the dark of night. The entire enterprise was kept secret, as dirt was hidden in the basement of a building Beach bought for that purpose. The work went well, but just before they could complete their first line the press got wind and it became public. Beachs team worked extra hard to finish the subway, and in the grand style, they opened to the public on March 1, 1870. He charged twenty-five cents per passenger to travel from Warren Street to Murray Street. It was a huge success  carrying over 400,000 passengers in its first year of operation.Unfortunately, Tweed was outraged and vetoed future extensions to the subway. Tweed was eventually imprisoned for his corruption, and permission was given for Beach to resume work extending the subway, but unfortunately his private investors were fast disappearing, due to the beginnings of an economic crisis. The subway was not completed and remained hidden under the city completely sealed up (complete with the luxury car and machinery) until it was subsumed into the present City Hall Station. Here is the route of the subway on Google Maps.1
House of Wisdom
Lost to time
Rosaryofthepious-FullThe House of Wisdom was a library and translation institute in Abbassid-era Baghdad, Iraq. It was a key institution in the Translation Movement and considered to have been a major intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. The House was an unrivaled center for the study of humanities and for Islamic science, including Islamic mathematics, Islamic astronomy, Islamic medicine, Islamic alchemy and chemistry, zoology and Islamic geography. Drawing on Persian, Indian and Greek textsincluding those of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Euclid, Plotinus, Galen, Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhata, and Brahmaguptathe scholars accumulated a great collection of world knowledge, and built on it through their own discoveries.Along with all other libraries in Baghdad, the House of Wisdom was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Baghdad, in 1258. It was said that the waters of the Tigris ran black for six months with ink from the enormous quantities of books flung into the river. The amount of knowledge lost that year is indescribable. It is even more surprising that while most people are familiar with the destruction of the library of Alexandria, few know about the loss of the House of Wisdom.Works Cited

I don't mean it *all* the time I swear! I would say that mine is the way I walk. I bounce a lot when I walk,  people tell me that it's very distinctive. I am known around my college campus as the kid with the orange and green striped hat. I've worn it every day for three years.

We laughed about it, and now he regularly changes all his sheets. He also tries to stop me from moving his stuff around, but it doesn't work. Being an asshole.I frequently find myself in bizarre (or just amusing) situations.

My friends would have you believe that I get into them on purpose, but I maintain that they're (mostly) accidental.I'm very good at effectively "roasting" or tearing people down. It's gotten to the point where I don't even realize when I'm doing it and it's not exactly a good thing.I eat a bag of pretzels when I drink at the bar. They usually have like some food on a table. I find the pretzels. The pretzels belong to me.Have a deep voice, not as deep as a man's. People remember me by it. "Crazy"Putting 3 question marks at the end of my questions.USA!  USA!  USA!Telling people "fun facts" about anythingAmong my group of friends, being salty as fuck.my sarcasm that would also be my impending downfall.It used to be a very specific brand of Ukrainian cigarettes and Jameson. Now, it's Marb reds and Jameson.Really fucking stupid non-sequiters that I should stop doing.  I just love the "wait what?" look on peoples faces.Killing jokes.
Example: a dick joke is made
Me: it's funny because penisesCynical, sarcastic, pretty mean sometimes.
I wear sweaters and jeans every day, even in the summer. I live in Texas.Dreadlocks. And I'm white, so for some reason it's weird that I have them.I have been called the "bitchiest straight man ever" by  a number of people.Trust falling into people who aren't paying attention. Not in a way that would knock them over, just kinda in front of them. I dented my girlfriend's dishwasher with my head once.

This usually happens at parties. Red lipstick! It's gotten to the point where I have an extensive collection and wear it every day. Strangers at school stop me to ask if I'm alright if I skip a day.I'm smart and better than everyone around me at anything I care about enough to engage in. Even when they've already been doing it for "forever," my progress is always quicker/more efficient or brings up questions/issues they had never thought of before despite technically being at a higher level than me.Hopefully, I haven't had my last birthday yet. Alcohol, drugs and sex. Watching Netflix. WorkingI didn't celebrate.

No one remembered.Laser TagI was with a whole bunch of extended family. Cake was made for me :) This all happened coincidentally, since someone's 50th was the following dayDrove from DC to Philly in a frickin monsoon and had the best cheese steak of my puny existence. Went to Buffalo wild wings and my friends went around the table saying some of their favorite things about me. That was also the night that I realized that I had fallen for my best friend. She had organized this whole thing and I was amazed at how much she cared. Months later I told her how I felt about her. Dating her has been the best 4 months of my life so far  I went to the movies alone. I got the big popcorn and small soda. I liked it.Didn't.Dinner at a fancy restaurant with my friends! Batman-themed cocktail party. It was pretty fucking great.Bowling, pool hall, board games I worked so that was fun we were making a board and card game party with friends, played bang! for the first time, it was hilariousFive guysWorked the actual day, Vegas the weekend after.I went on a vacation to Hawaii and got engaged on an active volcano!Paris with SO for both our birthdays.Well, crap I was hoping to at least get one more...Spending the day skyping my now wife who was at the time long distanceI went to a psy trance (goa) rave. Truly marvellous.My SO and I have our birthdays just a day apart so we took a road trip down to the grand canyon and Zion for the week. We spent our birthdays camping for free in national forest and hiking throughout some of the prettiest area I've seen.nothing. i turned 20 and my parents bought me a hamster because i wanted one when i was 14?? and i didn't want it so i gave it to my brother and my mom flipped shit on me. fun day. oh yeah, i worked too.Went to the archery range then on a short hike, followed by Cold Stone and then home to re-watch Game of Thrones. It was a pretty good day.Sushi dinner buffet downtown, absinthe at a fancy upscale bar, back to my place for CaH and litres of alcohol.

You only turn 20 once.doing homeworkIt was my 25th and I also graduated from law school the same day. I had a small gathering with some family, and then I went to a buddy's graduation/family Christmas party and got really drunk with some friends and sang some Christmas carols. Easily the best birthday I've ever had.Worked and watched TV after work.

Edit: I got 3 phonecalls though. That was pretty thrilling.Celebrated my 18th with my family, immediately followed by extreme nausea for a week then bad dehydration I went to school, and that was pretty much it.**Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*I'd tell them that death is like sleep, except they never wake up again. So they don't really 'go' anywhere.Don't have kids yet, but as an atheist who will probably have kids someday....
I would tell him/her that there is no way to know what happens after we die, but some people believe that our souls go somewhere else when our bodies stop living. There are different stories depending on who you ask, and everyone has their own reasons for believing what they believe, but ultimately we can't ever know, and it's up to you to figure out what you believe in based on what you learn from asking questions and finding out facts."Nobody knows what happens when you die, and anyone who claims otherwise is lying"Not a parent, but if I was, something like:

"We don't know. Some people think that after you die, you just get born again somewhere else. Other people think you go someplace special, as a reward for being so good when you were alive. Other people think you don't go anywhere at all. Do you remember what it was like before you were born? Well, that's because you didn't exist. You didn't exist before you were born. Some people think you don't exist *again* after you die. That's what makes right now special. Because right now, we're here. And right now, we have each other."I would answer just as I answered both of my kids so far...I don't know, nobody knows, it's one of the great mysteries of life and one that you will change your mind about many times as you grow and develop. 

And as they have gotten older I have told them to be very careful about anyone who thinks they can answer this question - as they can't - no one can.Well, little Billy, the only answer I can give you is "I don't know." In fact, no one knows. After all, people who die can't exactly come back to tell us what's what. But the thing is, there are a lot of good guesses out there.

Some people think that you leave your body behind and go to a wonderful, eternal paradise called "Heaven," where everything is always perfect, and you're surrounded by the people you love. Some people think your soul gets put into a newborn animal or person somewhere on the planet, in an endless chain of recycling. That's called "Reincarnation."

...What do I think? Well... Try to remember what it was like for you before you were born. Mmh... can't remember anything? Exactly! I think death would be a lot like that. An endless amount of time I can't even see, touch, hear, feel, smell, or remember. I wouldn't even be around to think about how boring it is. I'd just be *gone*, in the truest sense of the word.

So, dear little Billy... It's important to treasure this life you have right now. No matter what happens after death, no matter what you believe... All we know for sure is that we can make our time on Earth something special. Now go play your nintendo playstation or whatsits.My kid is six, he hasn't asked yet but when he does I'll explain death scientifically. When an organism dies it decomposes. There is no heaven or afterlife, so make the most of every day you're alive. Eventually we all die.I was caught off-guard when this question popped up. I ended up saying that people's bodies go away, but we remember them in our minds, so they become our memories, which are part of us. It seemed to do the trick. If I were an Atheist parent and my child asked me that I would say "They don't go anywhere, as long as we remember them." Or I'd say something asshole-y like "I dunno, but don't go into daddies Forbidden Shed, maky?"I can't help but think of Mr Mackey right now with the sock puppet, "You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!" "Nobody knows"They live on in our memories and dreams while making way for the younger people.I'll be honest to him and tell him that I don't know. It's okay not to know everything. "Better to have unanswered questions than answers that can't be questioned."

If that isn't a satisfying answer to him, then I will just ask him "What do you think you were doing before you were in mommy's belly? Maybe that's what you'll be doing when you die." 

Even though I don't believe in an afterlife [as depicted by various religions around the world], I don't think that closes the mystery of what happens after we die. He's too young now, but perhaps I can teach him to appreciate the mystery and the resulting urgency to focus on and enjoy this life, rather than worry about what will happen once he's dead. 

I told my son different peoples' beliefs, and then I told him something along the lines of:

"I believe it's like your xbox one. You can turn it off for a while, but you can turn it back on whenever you want. That's like sleeping. When you die, it's like the power cord gets pulled out of the wall and stays off, forever, and can never be turned back on because it no longer works." When it came up in our family, we had a discussion about the different possibilities and explained that no one really knows the truth about where you go, if anywhere when you die. Their initial experience was the death of our dog, followed by a grandparent and then more pets. We talked about it and it seemed to give them the okay to use their imaginations and come up with ideas and feelings about where they thought their grandfather and their dog/fish/goat/rat had gone. I told my kids you get to pick what you want your relatives to do with your body.. This question runs under the assumption that we go somewhere when we die. We don't go anywhere, we just aren't. You are a small, little meat sack barely existing on a pathetic chunk of rock in the middle of an ever-expanding universe of infinite darkness.

Basically this, except a little bit lighter and with a few hugs thrown in.

I hope someone who knows something about this answers you.Our equipment is tailored for right handers and left handers,  so assuming all other things are equal,  if shouldn't matter.The only way I could see this having any difference would be in street to street fighting and using cover. For example someone who is right handed may have to shoot from their off hand to maintain good cover. Someone who is ambidextrous might not be hindered by this incredibly niche problem that modern training pretty much eliminates.

I remember pausing the songs even with my headphones on out of worry that my parents would hear the lyrics. Anything Daft Punk turned me on to different dance genres during high school really opening my musical taste (disco, funk, jungle, garage, etc.). Oh and The Smiths (as an angsty teen) probably opened up my world to punk rock and 80's alternative. My friends introduced me to a bunch of indie shit present and past. Can't think of any album changing my life though.Rush 2112. 

Just discovered weed was far superior to alcohol (for me) and this album hits, wow. Stone Temple Pilots - Core808s & Heartbreak by Kanye West. I had just lost my best friend and was severely depressed. Was contemplating suicide until I started listening to this.Tool -  Lateralus.   Good Kid M.A.A.D City by Kendrick Lamar. I was already into hip-hop, but whenever I actually sat down and listened to the whole thing, I was mesmerized. It's rare that an album can be so well paced, tell a story without preaching it, and feel like it's not forced. It's incredible. Automatic For the People - REM"Christ Lag In Totesbanden", Karl Richter and the Bach Choir And Orchestra Of MunichThe Cure - Head on the DoorJimi Hendrix Live at Monterey Pop Festival.

I could actually see and feel his movements during the show just by listening. He's the main reason I picked up a guitar. Watching the live videos of the album were even more inspiring.The soundtrack to the movie The Fountain. It introduced me to the whole genre of /r/postrock, life changing music.

Metallica- Kill em all.When i hit the play button and heard Hit the lights it changed my life.Flood by They Might Be Giants.

If it wasn't for listening to that album, I wouldn't have gotten into TMBG. And if it wasn't for TMBG, I wouldn't have gotten into Mono Puff, John Linnell, or Sleater-Kinney. If I haven't gotten into Sleater-Kinney, I wouldn't have gotten into Heavens To Betsy, Team Dresch, Tacocat, Skating Polly, Wild Flag, Ex Hex, Corin Tucker Band, or the show Portlandia. I wonder who I would listen to if it wasn't for Flood.Kimbra - VowsI'd keep my job, I'd just stop giving a fuck about the risk of getting fired and do things how I think they should be done.Stay at home, play video games and watch pornGo to the gym.

All I really want is to entertain people. It's just hard to pay the rent with laughter.Buy into modern and legacyStart a little farm for animals who have suffered abuse or factory conditions. Have them live merely as animals, not as meat. Expect nothing of them than to just live their lives and be animals. 

Oh and lay eggs because I like eggs.Start a water polo league where the participants ride narwhals.Pursue my hobbies. Blacksmithing, kludging, making YouTube videos, gardeningTravel. If money were not an issue, I'd go see all the places I've never seen and explore the world's bookstores and libraries. I'd do exactly what I'm doing now.  Live in a tent on a 100 acre tree farm, writing music, taking nature walks, and feeling zero stress about obligations or debts, resulting in happiness and productivity on things I truly care about.I'd have a giant house built to scale as though I were a baby. Huge furniture, counters I can't reach the top of etc. Then I'd commission a huge baby stroller and just pay someone to push me around in it. I'd still probably find a job. Double income could really help me take care of my relatives.I would love to say I would travel the world, or volunteer, or find a way to save the planet but honestly I would do nothing. Probably buy a comfier couch, a newer TV and more video games.Honestly? I'd still work.  I think I'd go crazy without some sort of work to occupy my time.Look after my kids. Compose music. Write open source software. Travel. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep for decades of not sleeping. first take a few months to totally detox from working..

Propably travel or start streaming twitch. I mean I'm a casual player, don't know if people would even watch me on twitch (think not) but I could try it out and provide the same schedule every day Carry on exactly as I am, at uni, just with more drunkennessBuy a truck that wasn't always needing repairs. 

Then I would just fish. That's all I've ever wanted.A little 10 acre self sustainable farm. Off grid except for internet. Look for a job I actually enjoy, get a dog, fix a couple things in the house, get a girlfriend.Every single advice website states that you find your true passion by thinking about what you would do if you had unlimited resources and money.

I would do absolutely nothing if I could. Nothing makes me happier than my schedule being completely free so I can do nothing. The feeling of "having nothing to do" is my passion. We are always "forced" to do something or entire lives if we want to live. Work, responsibilities, obligations, promises, commitments. The only thing I want to do in my free time is the opposite of that.

To my knowledge, there is no field that will pay you 60k to sit at home in the sun, watching the world turn.Build a startup. I have many ideas that I'm too afraid to take heads on, fail and go bankrupt, because they're a risk. If I didn't have to worry about starving I'd feel a lot more comfortable to innovate.Volunteer a lot, visit countries,See how long I can get by in a strange country.

And get in the best shape of my life. Make pottery. Travel. Get a condo in a city like Barcelona or Porto. Build myself an arts studio. Eat rare foods. Learn French fluently.I would be on reddit all fuckin day building up that sweet sweet karma and then show it off to all my friends that I don't have.I'd actually keep my job, I love it, but I would cut down to half time and only work August to May. Premium gas button at the gas station. And probably reddit all day :(Vidya games in my beach bungalow. Then booze. Then beach.I'd get all the keyboards and keycap sets I want.Pursue my dream job of becoming a wildlife cameraman.I want to say I'd learn a musical instrument, go on fantastic adventures, and all of this stuff but I think the worrying answer to this is that I'd just stay at home and do nothing all day.  I'm extremely bad at motivating myself to do things.  Without a reason to leave the house I probably wouldn't.  What income? :(What would I do if my income were taken care of? Literally, anything. Go fishing. A lot of drugsI would rock and roll all nite and party every day! I'd make art and travel. Art as in paintings, music, videos and animation. And I'd be able to make whatever I want and keep refining it untiI master it, because there won't be any financial pressure to make things on someone else's teuntil

My day job I'd keep, but at half the hours, just to keep other people as a normal part of my daily life.Buy a newer car. probably what i do now, getting high and painting housesMusic and travel Not assemble bakes for Akebono, that's for goddamn sure.

Source: on a break, on a fucking Saturday.Quit work, then buy house for family ect and hobbies, lots and lots of hobbies, gardening, exercise, mechanics, building, landscaping and probably buy motorcycles fix and sell them as well even of there wasn't a profit to be had. Mine is. I travel some but not as much as I'd like to. Some days I sleep to 10 AM and others I nap in the afternoon. I meet with friends for drinks or dinner. Spend time on yardwork and often spend hours on the internet at places like Reddit. But the thing I like best is playing with my grand children.I really love my job and my apartment so I'd keep both of those. What I'd do more of is travel.snorkel in the Caribbean in the winter, hike the mountains and swim in the mountain lakes and rivers in the summer...I'm a Pisces. Photography and run an animal rescue shelter.Continue my career and workoutFinally write my darn book. Re-take every math class from Calc 1 to the end of my uncompleted math minor. I have a list of languages I'd learn. I'd like the AT and the PCT, and probably look for hiking opportunities in Europe and Africa as well. Practice piano way more. Assuming this means I'd continue receiving a U.S. income, I'd move to a lower-cost country, live off peanuts, and bank the rest of it.Slightly off but for those who said travel, have you traveled alone and if so do you have tips for enjoyment while traveling alone?Start an aerospace manufacturing company Travel and hone photography skillsIf money wasn't an issue at all, I'd move my family back home to New Orleans and help take care of my mom. 

If it was just taken care of enough to where I didn't have to work, I'd do exactly that. I'd stop working and enjoy spending time with my kids while they're still kids.Make more incomeKill myself through consumption of vodkaProbably try and enjoy the rest of my time alive.
Go swimming, cycling/touring, backpacking, play/compose music, make video games, learn and read more. I'd finish my MBA, take actual vacations instead of time off, and do the things I want to have fun.I'd travel the world paying people compliments and helping them.Honestly, here's the real answer:

~~i would keep working and make sure i build myself a good safety net, do something that makes me happy~~

Sit around all day and catch up on all the games I've missed out on.write a novel...or travel.Volunteer at a animal welfare shelter.I would travel with my family.  We would stay in locations for a month or more to learn about the culture.  

In addition to traveling I want to take up writing, again, and build my short stories.  I need to write and get the stories out of my head.  

There are also so many books that want my eyes. They want them bad.  

Ideally I would have more time to do volunteer work, too.Two chicks at the same time.I would still be a fifth grade teacher. I'd just take better vacations.  And not worry how much I spend on my kids.I would just buy neglected cars off craigslist and fix them up. 

That's actually what j plan to do when I retire. 


That would allow me to spend a lot more time with my wife and son. Honestly, I would try to find out where the money is coming from and offer to help. I hate people spending money on me. 

Either that or do sciencey shit. I would go to school forever. Build a fab lab and a new pavilion-style home. Start a furnitecture, modular building, and alternative/relief housing studio. Publish a Maker's Guide To Modular Building Systems. Prototype a nomadic eco-village and demonstrations of Mobilist lifestyle. Build a high-tech indoor farm. Setup a space telerobotics lab and community-run prototype telebases. Work toward creating a series of OTEC industrial/farming complexes to end Global Warming. Not ascribing arbitrary meaning to your life tends to shorten your life. That's why they say love is necessary to life because with love comes conflict and thus arbitrary meaning. If you live your life only indulging your desires with no hardships it would certainly lead to an earlier death than the contrary. I'd be a full time student. I wouldn't worry about actually passing the classes or whatever, just showing up to lectures and learning about what I thought sounded interesting. Go to school full time and quit my jobI'd begin tourney hopping for all of the games I play.

Melee, Magic, Hearthstone, Rocket League, etc.

Since my income is taken care of, I can go to tournaments, afford to travel, and can just focus on getting better one loss at a time.I'd fix computers in trade for delicious baked goods.Home cooked meal every meal. Midday yoga. Midday movies. Keep my nails really nice. Hike. Swim. Maybe get a fun food related job without worrying what it pays. Travel, focus on hobbies, volunteer, etc. Everything I don't have much time for thanks to work...Become a traveling therapist Keep up my job. Work my way up to larger businesses. Start my own company, make good money, and then indulge in my hobbies while I watch my empire grow.Poopas I have no children as of yet, I would spend my time taking care of our home, focusing on hobbies, doing a lot of volunteering and animal rescues as well as have another pet around the house that I've wished to have for some time.

My Visa balance which I have carried for years is plummeting nicely now.I quit my soul-sucking job and went back to school in my late 20s to follow my dream of being an evolutionary biologist. I started at the bottom with freshman chemistry and within eight years had a PhD (four years prep, four years for the actual doctorate), and was able to do it emerging debt-free.

EDIT: Just to add, since it wasn't obvious, I did indeed become an actual working evolutionary biologist.

EDIT2: I am getting the same questions a lot so I will answer them here. The way I did it debt-free is that I took the undergrad requirements for a biology major slowly, one or two classes at a time, over four years. I paid as I went along, and had two jobs with flexible schedules during that time. All good biology PhD programs are tuition-free and give you a stipend. After my PhD, I chose to travel a lot and take a bunch of different research fellowships. Eventually, I met my partner and we decided to "settle down" and I got a "real" job. I now run a research group at a research institute that has a graduate school where I am affiliated faculty.There was 42 pizza bites in the 40 pack I bought today!I have absolutely no debt.

I had a happy childhood, have no toxic relationships, like my roommate, like my siblings, like their girlfriends, and like my boyfriend.

I was too young to appreciate it, but an average after school day would be something like my brother and I and a couple friends going around on a boat and just fishing out there or looking at shit. A couple times we saw sting rays (manta? idk, it's been years) as big as our boat or sharks.

It seemed like nothing out of the ordinary growing up there, but years later I'd kill to be able to live in a place like that again.I'm eating a burrito right now.I stubbed my toe last week while watering my spice garden and I only cried for 20 minutes.I get paid $212.46 a week to attend college. I also have no college on Fridays.

Edit: I live in a western European country and if you meet a certain criteria such as being unemployed and not dependent on your parents you can get an education supplement. I also get 3,000 yearly for college fees. If it wasn't for this I would probably be a bored alcoholic of some sort. Being unemployed is no joke. Also I'm studying computer science.  My SNES still works and I still have my game library from childhood. Plus the stuff that I bought as an adult. A mint condition, complete with everything, Chrono Trigger is my prized SNES gem.I have a brain damaged cat.

That fucker is better than TV.

Edited to add:

He falls over and rolls on his back when he tries to clean himself.

He doesn't see or smell very well, so to help him find his food, I tap the bowl until he has his face in it.

He lies on his back when my 83# dog sniffs his face, batting at the snout like it's a cat dancer dipped in chicken.

When I take the other dog (HIS dog) out of the house, he cries and tries to follow us.

If I leave him in one room and go elsewhere, sometimes he gets lost and walks around yelling until I call him repeatedly (if I stop before he finds me, I may as well not bother).

He doesn't understand how the other cat goes under the furniture, so he usually ends up running into the side of the couch or bed when they play chase.

He walks on a leash.

Post-seizure, sometimes his feet are very hot, and he likes to walk in an inch or so of cool water.

If anyone is louder than he is, he follows them around, screaming at them (does not apply to TV).

Other animals can tell how weird he is, and they treat him differently than they treat normal cats. He may get knocked over every now and then, but he doesn't get chased (although he did get herded back to the house by one of our dogs, the one time he got free).

I am gross, so sometimes instead of using a napkin, I will wipe food on the cat so I can watch him fall over trying to get it.

He eats clay litter, so we have to buy corn and pine and cedar.

He has this weird mutant metabolism, eats up to twice as much as the other cat and still doesn't gain weight.

And so many, many more things are awesome about having a retarded cat.I'm looking out off my deck and the view is spectacular! Beautiful mountains, trees, blue skies, a few white clouds! Such a beautiful day!I had a solid bowel movement today.I've been to over 60 countries. I haven't seen a winter in about 3 years.

Edit because I am getting similar comments a lot: I have moved around in different continents during the last few years, thus dodging winters. I think winter can be lovely, but I had very long winters for a long time, so I decided to take a break. No, I am not melting all the time. Just in more temperate places with cold weather here and there :) I know I am not impressing you if you were born and raised in, and never left, a sunny place. 

Edit 2 because same reason: Yes, I work and need to work to be able to afford food and stuff :) I've worked in "regular" offices before. You can do odd jobs in a lot of places, or teach, or work in hospitality, or busk, or work from your computer if that's your thing. There is also volunteering.

Edit 3: Yes, of course there is a flip side, it's not all fun and adventures 24/7. I do have to work (fortunately), I do have problems, of course. I do get sad, worried, lonely, homesick  and things are not easy all the time. I just sacrifice certain stability for now because I always wanted to travel around the world and you can't have everything.

Edit 4: From the bragging Hawaiians, comments have moved to winter fundamentalists :). I am not totally anti-winter. I already said winter can be great.

I sleep in a racecar bed Just got back from a puppy play date at the park. It was like WWE but with 3 fluffy and uncoordinated little squishballs.I have a kitten curled up and sleeping on my chest right now. I'm coming up on my 5 year anniversary with a beautiful wife who shares many of my hobbies and interests.  We have never had a fight.

Edit: To clarify, I don't mean we never have disagreements. I mean we have never fought. No shouting, casting blame, shaming, etc.I have enough time at my job to where I can retire with a pension and benefits. I have more than a month of salary saved up. That's more than most people nowadays. I just got out of the hospital. Had a CT Scan after having a migraine for a full week. I am brain problem free! My cat guards me while I'm in the shower and when I'm drying off, always jumps on the rim of the tub and demands a smooch on the head. Kitty head boop. I have really long eyelashesMid 6-figure salary. Not the richest person, but I'm also only 28. Life is good.I can buy and smoke weed legally. Also, my calves are really nice looking. One of my characters in World of Warcraft has the `Realm First! Celestial Defender` achievement. I swam with wild sting rays in the CaribbeanUsed to be a real life rock star.If you like Korn, I went on Jonathan Davis' bus and played a match of Call of Duty 4 with him. The next year I went on Fieldy's bus and got a one-on-one bass lesson from him.I've had sex.I've traveled to over 30 different countries, and I'm not yet 30 years old.My puppy is sleeping quietly next to me with her head on my leg.I have no debt and over 6 figures in savings. I'm in my 20s.I get free airtravel. Also my girlfriend is bi and likes to fuck other girls with me.

Edit- bi not bigger. Damn auto correct. Lol.I love my job, I go to work everyday a happy man. I work from home in a heavily forested area of the Pacific Northwest doing CADD for a company that restores WWII era fighter planes. I had a threesome with my piece of shit boss' ex wife and her 25 year old female friend. I can eat a lot and never gain weight. I just got my final grades for the Spring semester. Five A's and one CNothing big but the past 3 days have been really awesome. I'm on a streak. Got my crush's phone number (literally took me months to do), left my shitty group of friends and found a cool one, aced a test that I REALLY needed to pass... Basically almost every little thing has worked out in my favor. It's kind of weird actually. My best friend just told me he's in love with me. I'm in love with him too. I will be interning at Intel over the summer!I had an eargasm and an orgasm simultaneously. 

I was having sex with my girlfriend after showering together and I had water stuck in my ear. Right as I came, my ear popped and I experienced both sensations at the same time. Sadly, it has not happened to me again, but I hope one day I will experience it again.I've only thought about suicide once this week!I work at Disneyland and can go into the park almost whenever I want for free.I got $250k from the sale of my share of the family home to my sister so these last few months I have become basically debt free, bought a new car, and am doing a whole bunch of renovations to my house, all paid for upfrontJust graduated from Cambridge in Medicine and already have a placement at a private hospital. Dad gave me a brand new Mercedes C-Class 2016 as a present & I'm getting married to the love of my life of 7 years next summer. Ohh, and also that I'm a good liar..I didn't pick this screen name for no reason.I'm sitting here in the hospital with my newborn daughter asleep on my lap.Super late to this so it will get buried, and actually only like 4 of my friends know, but my net worth is around $30 million, because my father has land in India (~25 acres) that the government wants to build housing projects on, and he owns a 8 hotels. Luckily I've been brought up to be humble, never knowing how much we were worth until my mom and dad recently updated their will telling me about our net worth and that my wife will have to sign a pre-nupt![These are my dogs, they love to cuddle.](http://i.imgur.com/1FN21iA.jpg)I live a mile from Venice Beach.I understand the difference between "jealous" and "envious." ;) Was 17, got wasted and got finger f*cked by a female friend. Before that night, I thought I was pretty straight. 

I'm dating her now!Turn water into wine.Fucked a bunch of guys.One time I stayed up all night playing Diablo....on a school night!*Someone* smeared peanut oil all over a bully's belongings. 

She was severely physically & mentally abusive to many students & bragged about torturing animals, including her beautiful collie, for fun. She was supposedly deathly allergic to peanuts but was also a pathological liar so no one was entirely sure until this. 

She went into anaphylactic shock, had to be stabbed with a fierce Epi Pen & was rushed to the ER. 

It was a solid reality check for her, & every time she started acting out of line again she'd be slipped a threatening note signed "Mr. Peanut" in magazine clippings, ransom note style.

I miss my carefree teen years. Your mom I once rode my bike down the street without a helmet.Sucked dick in lotsa parking lots.Pee out of a window of a moving vehicle on the highway. I also don't have a penis. My friends and I decided shooting kids with a Beebee gun would be a good idea. Two days of it plus shooting a cop car. Front page of the newspaper calling us snipers. Shit our pants.... White privilege triumphs into probation and community service. My father knew the probation judge and my other friend had a high price lawyer! I uh.. once did... a very small amount of weed... didn't... didn't do anything... I... uh... I took a single puff from a ciggarette... didn't like it... Once I... uh... hm... *fuck*Tie between three stories that all happened when I was 15:

1) Stole wine from an abandoned apartment whose tenant had been evicted then drank it in a park bathroom 

2) I befriended a 23 year old at 2am and agreed to go to his house so he could show me his MLP artwork and introduce me to his new dog. I got free cigarettes, beer, weed, and a copy of Portal out of the visit. And wasn't raped! 

3) Ate a bunch of pizza, took some oxy, smoked some weed that went down the wrong pipe which caused me to throw up and decided I needed to consume more oxy because of the regurgitation. Then I walked a mile to a taco bell in the middle of a huge rainstorm with a few friends only to find out that the taco bell was closed. I cried.


To clarify: I was not a bad kid. I wasn't an addict, I never had run ins with the police, and I graduated with a high gpa from an honors high school and got a 4 year scholarship to a private college. I was just weird underclassman who had too much free time and liked to smoke.Respected my parents... if that's okay with youstole some shrubs from sci-fi writer Robert A.

After a certain level of musical knowledge, all guitarists are about the same. There are only 12 notes available to any musician and only so many scales to combine them.  So it becomes about tone and note choices, which scales a guitarist uses and how they emphasize the chords.  I like both complex stuff like Reelin in the Years or Kid Charlemange by Steely Dan, but for me the best blues based stuff is early 70s Allman Brothers like Whipping Post. But it's just a matter of what style resonates with you personally, there is no answer to the question.  Terry Kath - 25 or 6 to 4

https://youtu.be/wwyXQn9g40IMy first day on my first show, I was waiting in the loading dock of the Kodak with a radio to let the producers know when Aretha Franklin arrived. As I'm waiting there, I get a poke in the back and turn around to see Danny Devito. He says, "hey kid, let me use your cell phone." 

"Uh, sure thing, Mr. Devito," I say. 

I hear him make a call to someone who is either picking him up or dropping something off for him and then he gives me my phone back. 

"Is your battery dead?" I ask.

"No, I just wanted to use yours," he says and walks away. Worked on a couple of movies in the late 90s in Las Vegas that had Kurt Russell and Chevy Chase in them (in different movies).  Never cared about either of them one way or the other before the movies, but both did things that I saw that impressed me.

Kurt Russell was in Breakdown, and he was the most down to earth person.  The thing that I remember that really impressed me was that he would fly home every night to be with his family, and that he helped with his kid's cub scout group.

Also around the same time, worked on the set of Vegas Vacation.  In one of the scenes, Chevy Chase demanded that one of the kids who was an extra be allowed to speak a line.  Impressed me because there is a different wage scale for people who speak.

Never did like either of the movies, though.Hair on 90210--everyone I met was nice but high as fuck....either almost asleep or bouncing off the walls. Do you have any idea how hard it is to blow dry someones hair who can't sit still or is nodding off and sliding out of the chair? Ahhh the 90's, how fun! Also why I'm now an accountant, hair stylists are crazy! Not me but my sister has worked on various horror films, before being recruited to Zombie Land she was made an offer to join and be the assistant to Quentin Tarantino on Kill Bill Vol 2, she said the amount of vulgarity, yelling and overall unpleasantness of him made her quit in the first month. Apparently he has some really weird/high demands of his crew. Sean Penn told continued to smoke inside the editing room and told me to fuck off when I pointed out that no smoking is allowed inside.  

Stalone likes to draw really shitty pictures of himself (like, elementary school quality) and stick them up in his dressing room. He also had a no eye contact rule on the set of Demolition Man. 

Wesley Snipes used to hit on every asian chick in Vancouver while he was there. I think he married a Korean. But anyways, he wasnt faithful to his wife and threw dick towards any girl of Asian decent. My aunt, because her dad was pretty important in the production of Star Wars, has a picture of her and Mark Hamill on the set of A New Hope. They also were family friends with Jim Henson so he was over at their house a lot and gave her one of the original muppets for her birthday when she was young. The film industry is wacky.I worked with some of CNN's top production people, including their CEO, and Anderson Cooper.

Incredibly down to earth people.  I was casually chatting with the CEO (who had spent the gig actively assisting with running the video switching) for about 5-10 minutes along with one of their top directors and had no idea who he was till after.  

They turned our space inside-out but spared no expense putting everything back together like they weren't even there.  

I disagree with their politics, but CNN's people were more down to earth than some local production people I know.I worked on screen with Hayden Panettiere on Nashville, and I'm pretty sure she was high off her ass. At least she was nice!Gary Busey borrowed my pencil and then ate the eraserI work in sports television. Warren Sapp is a miserable human being. Treats everyone around him like filth.Girl and guy I knew in highschool both were big into plays and wound up getting together and opening a makeup studio together. They said everything was really cool except Johnny Depp on more than one occasion has started doing his own makeup and changing things sometimes completely taking over the process. This sounds fine and all but remember they have to be able to repeat the look EXACTLY the next time.on my first PA gig i met Seth Gilliam (Carver from The Wire). Super nice guy, didn't mind me geeking out on him about how much I loved The Wire.
More interesting story, I was a Unit PA for a week on Amazon Prime's Mozart in the Jungle. At the end of every shooting week the PA's play a game where everyone working on set draws from a deck of cards and puts in ten bucks and at the end of the night they draw a card and whoever is picked wins the pot. I drew the 6 of spades and put in my $10. Welp, shooting comes to an end around 2AM and Sir Malcolm McDowell gets on the walkie to announce the winner and wouldn't you know it, 6 of spades. I walk over to show my card and he says "AHH YOUNG MAN, THE WINNER, CONGRATULATIONS YOU WIN $5000 DOLLARS AND AN ALL EXPENSE PAID TRIP TO ITALY!!! HA!HA!!!!" and then proceeds to rub my shoulders. I actually won about $300 and no trip to Italy but it was cool anyway. EDIT: wordsActors, for the most part, are pretty insecure people based on the fact that as they came up the ladder they were always trying to impress a director, producer and ultimately the audience.  As they become successful they start wanting more power, control of their character, how their character is written in the script, how it's produced etc.  Hence, why you see a lot of actors as executive producers, co-writers and so on.  If they're working on a project that they don't like they tend to reflect that back to those around them.  I worked on a film with SL Jackson and he really didn't like the young director and you could hear that in every exchange they had.  But he could be a great guy in his personal life.  It seems the actors/directors that have the most self control, are sure of their character, they enjoy their character, are the ones who are the easiest to get along with.  It's kinda similar with directors, the more control they are of their project the more relaxed they are and tend to be more accepting of collaboration.  Some of my worst experiences have been with young, inexperienced actors and directors who haven't gotten their egos under control and that spills over onto everyone.Some are cool and some are dicks.  Really no one is going to expand too much if they enjoy staying in the industry i am an assistant director and i happened to work with many directors so far, the greatest of them all was Tarantino. The guy is a legend he describes every scene based on movies he has seen, so in order to work for him you need to have seen a whole bunch of movies to understand what he wants to do, but he is awesome and we all love Quentin.While I work at a major animated film studio, I don't see actors very often. Part of it is that, while we have a recording studio on campus, much of the recording is done elsewhere, and when they do record on campus, they're taken in the back way for privacy. That, and I'm usually off doing my job at my desk.

My most intimate encounter was when James Hong politely asked me where the studio store was.I was at a party a few weeks ago and met a guy that works in the film industry, and said he has worked with Christopher Nolan a few times. he said that Nolan is a really nice guy and only saw him blow up on set once - They were filming something and there was about to be an explosion, and some guy on set started walking towards the explosion location just moments before it was to go off. He said Nolan lost it and told the guy to 'get the fuck off of his set!" I find that completely understandable.I don't know how true this is but I lived in the San Fernando valley in the 60's.  At my junior high school, I was one of only a very few non-Jewish children.  I knew all about bagels and lox and bas mitzvahs and never thought twice about any of it.   My apt bldg was owned by a character actor and a director.   While I'm a bartending Australian, I really enjoy Kevin Smiths marvelous stories.The main actor on a big budget is often on a strict workout regime for the inevitable shirtless or sleeveless scene.

Sorry I don't have the linkgo fuck yourself- https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2n8ap9/what_is_the_best_way_to_tell_someone_to_go_fuck/This story... It's been posted in multiple threads: 
There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: "November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground." Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "Houston Center voice." I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in the Beech. "I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed." Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.

Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. "Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check." Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: "Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground." And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: "Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.

"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground." I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: "Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money."

For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with, "Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one." It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.


[What youtube videos have you crying with laughter?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1c28m0/what_youtube_videos_have_you_crying_with_laughter/)I thoroughly enjoyed Donald Faison's AMA that Zach Braff trolled.

EDIT: [Link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1vzh42/donald_faison_ama_all_welcome/)More recently, the guy at r/casualiama with the canned sardine down his cast[This comment chain](https://www.reddit.com/comments/6nz1k/got_six_weeks_try_the_hundred_push_ups_training)There was an AMA by Dani Daniels (a porn star) where someone had asked her a question that was deleted, but from her answer, one could gather that they had asked what her parents thought about her line of work. She said they were fine with it and supported her. Someone replied to her comment with the following: "So your mom is fine with it, and so is your stepdad?"

[This was me when I read that reply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4NLFa0FR2w&feature=youtu.be&t=28s)When that one user had his language on our website changed to Spanish and he couldn't figure out how to undo it and so he asked reddit for help.

Everyone replied to him in Spanish.

https://www.reddit.com/comments/cq1q2/help_reddit_turned_spanish_and_i_cannot_undo_it/Steven Seagull AMAAs immature as it sounds r/carsfuckingdragons but also r/quityourbullshitIll be the first to admit that my deep and profound hatred of Ben Franklin has a lot to do with jealousy. 

 Everyone loves and respects Ben Franklin. Know how many people revere me? You could count them all on one hand. Heck ,Mordecai Three finger Brown could count them on one hand and still have enough fingers left over to flash you the peace sign and poke Bill Wambsganss in the eye. 

And there Franklin is staring at me, mocking me from every hundred dollar bill.

I even have recurring dreams where Im in this fight club deal with Ben Franklin. Which I wouldnt mind if I won some of the time. I may not be the toughest guy in the world, but surely I can beat up a 300 year old man. I know my dreams are just products of my subconscious , but you think my subconscious would be on my side. Im the one that feeds it.



And so much of it is unfair  Its hard for me to compete with him since he was born so long before I was. I cant very well be a founding father now. If there was another revolution Id kiss up to the new leaders and try to be considered on of the new founding fathers, but I cant very well overthrow the government on my own. I dont even know where it is at. I know where the post office and the department of motor vehicles is, but thats it. There has to be more to it than that.

And I cant even lie and take credit for his stuff. Do you know how drunk a girl has to get before you can convince he that you discovered electricity. Maybe if I was born first I would have invented bifocals. Maybe I would have invented a wood stove. I wouldnt have called it the Franklin Stove , thats for sure. Id call it The King George Stove just to piss off Ben. Or maybe the Cook-O-matic 1900, which would have seemed very futuristic to everyone back then.King Leopold. He may very well be the first recorded genesis of the Child Soldiers in Africa. He conscripted children, a majority of whom were likely orphaned by his men, into paramilitary troops that would further guard and enforce his exploitation of the Congo. He siphoned the natural wealth of the Congo, which would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars today, over several decades. He performed a brilliant propaganda campaign that deceived the western nations of the world into thinking he was there to provide humanitarian and "Civilizing" relief to the people. When the West finally started to catch on to the brutal massive mass murder, torture, and enslavement of the Congolese, Leopold managed to hold onto almost all of the wealth he siphoned through dozens of properties in the most expensive places in the world and transferred responsibility of the Congo to the Dutch government.

He unfairly convinced the nation that GM's Corvair division produced unsafe cars, using anecdotal and not true evidence.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*My daughter had a horrible mental illness.  It is undescribable how my life changed after this happened. My life was no longer about me, and only about trying to help her stay alive and live a comfortable life. It cost me my job, I just couldn't handle the stress at both work and then at home; I had to change work to something much less stressful.

She graduated from college today. I guess this is why I am willing to write about something so deeply personal.  So I won because she won.  I cried harder than any Dad at the graduation. And I'm proud of it. Having an abusive boyfriend. He was mentally abusive and once I got out of that relationship I was pretty fucked up. But I rebuilt myself slowly up until I found my current, amazing boyfriend. I am much stronger than I was ~7 years ago.Dealing with death, both my own loved ones and that of friends and acquaintances. It helps you realize how truly ephemeral life is.Deciding not go to the same post secondary schools as everyone else. Went to a more private one that was only a year vs the 3+ year curriculum that my friends are taking. Now, Im in the job i wanna do. Although I do feel like I miss out on the socializing aspect of those post secondary school. You win some, lose some Depression and attempted suicide. Both myself and a friend have tried.

It was expected that I lend a hand with the chores without compensation/allowance. Once I was old enough and wanted to purchase video games or go to movies/concerts, my parents told me to get a part-time job since they weren't going to pay for those bigger purchases.

Once I started working my part-time job, I realized how much time and effort it took to make the amount of money to spend on the things I wanted.The birth of my son. soz for long post

Child sexual abuse and a pretty bad eating disorder through high school that still lingers around (I'm 24 now). I had to put a lot of emotional work into dissociating what happened to me from my own sense of self. I don't really feel m/any negative feelings about what has happened to me other than it's just unfortunate, sometimes it makes me sad an it does affect my ability to trust people/be vulnerable but I'm dealing, and it's no reflection on my value as a person. I think this has made me quite accepting and understanding because I will not be shocked or disgusted about something someone is going through because I know it does not define them and I'll always hear ya out. 

The eating disorder was pretty cooked, I had to consistently choose to live when I felt like there was no reason to/I didn't deserve to (long story, I was overweight as a kid and my mum forced me to exercise or I wouldn't get food. Absolutely no shock to me that I developed AN. I feel a bit resentful about it, but I don't blame her). I'm still working on trying to 'give up' the eating disorder because, in contradiction to what I said above, it still feels like a very strong part of me even though I know it's just destruction. 

I had an emotionally abusive housemate (whom I loved dearly) for a year which was quite terrible. About 6 months in to living with him he attempted suicide, I found him and took him to the hospital and the emotional abuse got much worse quite quickly. I relapsed into my ED, developed quite bad anxiety which I had never experienced before and became addicted to valium. With the help of a psychologist I realised (and could act on this realisation) I am not responsible for other peoples' emotions and anyone who expects that from other people is unreasonable. 

More than anything, thinking about it now, I don't think I've been made stronger *by* the above, but that I got through all this crap, I've lived out of home supporting myself for 7 years, I'm in a happy, healthy relationship and I'm in grad school has made me realise that I am strong when I've never felt or thought that about myself before.

Also if any internet-stranger is going through some shit my inbox is always open, replies might be slow but this is a sincere offer.I got diabetes. It taught me how I was hurting my body and mind, and that helped a lot. Pacing up on a bike to ride 200 miles away from 22 years of sexual/physical/emotional abuse.

You grow up real fast hauling 120lbs of cargo on a bike across a state dodging an abuser.Having a friend and mentor commit suicide by jumping off an overpass onto a major interstate. It changed my life forever.Gosh... take your pick. My parents divorced around the time I was 4. We moved in with my grandparents who were very verbally abusive to brother and mom and myself. I was shy and timid so I was bullied pretty bad at school. At 13 I started a home school program because a bunch of kids took my items out of the p.e. locker and knocked it on the ground and scratched up my glasses. I couldn't take it anymore so my mom tried home schooling me. No rules and severe depression I told my dad if I didn't get out of the situation I would without a doubt kill myself. At 14 years old I want from being in a place with no rules to going into an overly religious house hold with many many rules. I have always shown severe depression and anxiety for as long as I could remember so it was an adjustment. They'd let me on the computer and I'll email old friends about my pagan beliefs which I found out they were reading my emails and freaked out at me for straying for god. I confessed I found women attractive. It of course was the devil on my shoulder so I wasn't allowed to have sleep overs in my room. The books I read was closely watched. I once got The Vampire Lestat and my step mom came into the room screaming, "where was the evil Satan book?!" I was scared to get a young adult library card due to the fact I was scared they would disapprove of what I got. The more oppressed I felt the more I turned to cutting and the worse the panic attacks got. They pushed God more on me and started to pray and cross the house to keep the demons from me. They even cornered me in my room and tried to do an excorism. My step mom died in a freak car accident when I was 18 years old and I rebelled. I lost my virginity and smoked pot lied about where I was going and started to smoke. I got a couple tattoos and finally refused to go to church because it never felt right to me. Even though I rebelled I refused to do anything on my father's property in a type of respect for him. He kicked me out after a couple hospital stays and was convinced I would be found dead on the side of the road from a drug over dose  (never touched hard drugs in my life.) I talked to him when I jumped on a bus to GA to meet a guy I met on the Internet  (seriously) if I had broken into our old house. He was convinced I did it for drug money. Nope. Wasn't me. I move into a camping trailer on my grandparents property and Internet boyfriend came to live with me. Got kicked out again by abusive grandparents and got on disability. Moved around on 600.00 a month, lived with people and moved to different states and was homeless a couple times. Internet boyfriend became sexually and mentally abusive and tore me down to my core. He made me a hallow shell of who I once was. I met my now husband through a room mate and my ex. We've been married 6 years and dating 7 years now. My life has calmed down by a good bit and I still struggle with anxiety and depression. I've embraced my pagan life style and the fact I am a bisexual woman. I'm awkward and I don't take social hints well but I've got better. I usually can read people pretty well by just paying attention to them. I often get called "sweet" Which usually translates your so kind and I can run over you with no issue. I'm learning to love myself for me and to stand up for myself. I've had some recent hard ship but choose to be positive about it. Every negative experience every tear I've cried has made me a strong person who finds the positive in everything. I have learned to mostly not regret because regardless of what happened or what wrongs anyone has done to me they can't change it nor can I. Life is too short and sad to add extra drama and bullshit too it. I chose to keep it simple and just take care of my kids. I can't be anything other then myself.I've had depression all my life and anxiety since an event that's unrelated happened in my preteens. This isn't something I've grown from but with. 

About 4 years ago I got qualifications to work in a Childcare centre. I thought I didn't want kids and was uncomfortable around them at first but it literally changed the whole way around. I got more comfortable with them and enjoyed spending my day with them. I do want kids now. Not desperately, though. 

It also just helped me grow my confidence. Kids are just tiny people with different brain development and communication abilities/styles. They're super interesting. Being able to "talk" to a 2 year old made me realise that it's easier talking to an adult and helped with my anxiety around adults. 

Not gonna lie and say my social anxiety is cured - I still need a drink (or bowl) or two to be comfortable in a group of more than 3 and in 1 on 1 situations. 

Edit: I just have to add that I don't advise drinking to be comfortable if you easily go overboard like I do. I've made some interesting decisions when stoned/drunk that I don't know what to do with. whenever you are sad, depressed, or just not in a good mood remember life gets better but only if you make it better i was in a bad place for a long time in my life and tried to look for ways to make it better and thought there was no way it that it could and was always told by friends, family, and other people that it gets better and never thought it could for me but it has so just believe it will but don't just leave it to hope that is the biggest mistake i made.Being put into the mental ward against my will.  I didn't think I was that sick, and I don't even know what led to it. Perhaps a bit of drug use combined with my mothers overly conservative approach to the way she perceived my behaviour.

Anyway, I was in there for four long months. It was a strange experience, I definitely experienced some interpersonal psychotic symptoms but the environment made it so much worse for me. Some people seemed fair batshit (not trying to pass judgement but they were way gone) and I'm sure I would have been better off at home with a bit of medication. The health system here seems highly politicised and the mental ward is a pretty depressing place to be.

Anyway, now that I'm out I feel like a new person. It's like something I can pinpoint in my life where I can say yep, everything's okay now. Hopefully it lasts...Basically over a short period of time my life fell apart. I left my job for a start up with my best friend and the work dried up and she became someone I didn't like. I ended up redundant and my room mate threw a fit when I decided to leave town and follow my months old relationshit to another city. We broke up mere weeks later and I had to start all over again, by myself in a strange city with two friends. Its over a year since I moved and in all honesty its the best thing I've ever done. My current job isn't amazing but its steady and pays the bills. My new relationship is the healthiest and happiest one I have ever had, my car isn't a piece of crud and my cat is happy chasing small creatures. 

TL:DR beat my crippling depression by working my behind off to change my life.When a close friend became suicidal and I had to become more stronger person to lend them a hand.  The friendship became too much for me, but I left that situation stronger than and more matured then I was when I entered it.Congratulate him on his astute assessment and ask him why the fuck he's in my house.We order Chinese.

There I was with my dick in my hand, a few motions away from exploding when I started a search for something I wasn't interested in. 

I couldn't find anything. I had gone from having a jolly old wank to naked raging. Why could I not find some gay midgets fucking? Was I not on the internet, where every taste was catered for? It would have taken less than ten seconds to find a video of a woman shoving an octopus up her dumper but no videos of gay midget porn. There are homosexual little dudes out there. I know there are. Why do they not have anything for them? Are they forgotten? Or simply not cared about?

I learned this after years of worrying about what other people think. It's made my life so much easier.Debt sucks, as long as you have it someone else owns you. Bitching doesn't solve anything Only put smooth objects up your ass.If you want something you have to work for it. No one owes you anything 'just because'.Don't stick your fingers where you wouldn't stick your dick. Defeats are only defeats if you capitulate. You can learning something from everything.Be a good caring person and always think about how your words and actions will effect the others around you. People will respect you more and you will have a higher self image of yourself, which equals confidence. Having high confidence will take you places!Life is full of choices; some people make better ones than others.That life is hard work and that I'm not the centre of the universe. Everyone lives a life as complex as my own, have complex thoughts and lastly:

 everyone is too busy worrying about what other people think about them, so in reality there is no reason to care about what others think about you, becase they dont notice all your flaws and fuckups.Don't gossip.

Mind your fucking business.

Never take Ambien and an "overnight laxative" together.food goes into the upper holeLearn from past mistakes.Figure out what time we need to start working on something and then start like a week before thatTwo types of people, nails and hammers. And people would get offended by everything The best response to anger, resentment, and hate is love. Otherwise, you become part of the cycle of anger, resentment, and hate.This, too, shall pass.That even though I feel I have a good deal of experience, I still have and probably will always have much to learn.If you start a bew job and talk to someone, assume you are talking to 1000 people because you do not know who they will talk to.Confidence is key.Another person's success is NOT, by any means, your failure.

Change is inevitable. Everything is impermanent, both the good and bad in life. Every moment is but a passing one, simply a means to an end. Never get in your own way when applying for jobs.

I had the opportunity to apply for two jobs when I was younger.  Instead of applying for both, I applied for only one to show my "dedication".  I ended up not getting the promotion/next level and missed out on the other job they said would have been mine had I applied."It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not weakness, that is life!"It is imperative that you learn how to listen to and trust your gut.I learned far before the dawn of my favorite show House....everybody lies.Take yourself further than people think you'll go.The kindness of strangers is profound, both for the giver and receiver. Smile at a homeless person. Tell a CSR they've been very helpful. It doesn't take much to make a difference in someone's day. 

Never judge a creature's intelligence by comparing it to humans. Nature is brilliant in ways we may never understand.

Laughter. All the clichs are true. Life is hard, and Reddit taught me that people are goddamn funny! So find a good laugh or two when you're having a bad day. 

Some people are very friendly.
I thought they were flirting with me, but no, they are just very friendly.You hired me as the *bait* when do I get paid?

*goes to jail*Just wanna get the willy wet, nahsayin?Hey, I'm not gonna catch any predators without bait...At a time like this I think you should call your lawyer rather than posting questions on reddit.I thought this was my meth lab...I'm just here to cheat on my wife, were cool right?In the middle of a board game, I stood up to get another beer (a few feet from the game table) but had to remove the gallon of milk from the fridge to get the beer.  I picked up the jug, and matched eyes with a non-high friend of mine, for some reason thought I'd make him laugh by pretending to pour the milk on my head.  The cap was not on the jug properly.  My friend watch as stoned-me took a gallon of milk and poured it on my head.   Everyone was just as confused as I was as there was no rhyme or reason for any of it.   My explanation for why it happened wasn't very valid. Stood in an elevator for about 5 minutes before realizing that no one pressed any buttons. I was in my car hotboxing alone at like 2AM in a wooded parking area. All of a sudden I thought a crazy person was vigorously shaking my car for 5 seconds. Got out and no one was around. I was seriously questioning my sanity at that point. Didn't realize until I saw the news next morning that there was a 5.0 earthquake overnight and that I didn't smoke laced bathsalts.I was satisfying my munchies at the local popeyes and every thing was going fine up until I finished my order. At this point I looked the cashier straight in the eye and in a very serious tone asked him " is this for here or to go?". We stared at each other for a couple of seconds then I just nodded my head and said here , then walked away. Didn't realize what I had done until my friend told me.Saw a huge spider on the wall and decided the best way to kill it was with a straight leg lunge. I put a gigantic hole in the wall, and I have no idea what happened to the spider.Using my phone as a light to look for my phone. I walked into a fast food place, made a huge order.  I got all my food and drink, sat my food on a table and went to use the bathroom.  Then I walked out and went home and didn't realize what I did for at least two hours.Tried to open the door to my house with my car keys and became terrified when that wasn't working out for me.  My friend and I thought we invented cold hot chocolate and we were super amazed at our invention and thought we were culinary geniuses.  We excitedly told her sister who just said "so... chocolate milk?".I went to an all you can eat buffet and stacked up an entire plate of corn chips. In the corner of my eye I spotted an employee following me around. I got really paranoid and starting walking faster to try lose him but didn't want to turn around and look at him because then he would know I knew he was following me around. I must have done 3 or 4 laps of the entire buffet with this dude right behind me. I eventually worked up the courage to turn around, only to realise that I was slowly dropping corn chips all over the floor everywhere that I walked. The guy was following me with a dustpan and broom and cleaning up my mess. I have no idea why he didnt just tell me to stop. Felt like a proper dickheadFreshmen year of college I was working part-time at mall store making custom iron-pressed shirts. This store was usually slow after 9pm and it's just me, another employee, and the assistant manager. We're all cool with each other and have smoked outside of work before. Assistant manager thinks it would be funny if we got high during the last hour in the store. We agree, and the game plan was 2 people smoke in the storage room and 1 watches the store. Me and assistant manager go back in the storage room and smoke a bowl, then I tell her I'll watch the floor while our other associate joins her for the next bowl. I'm out on the floor, already high and with red eyes just chilling. Young couple walks in (shit!). They're just browsing and of course they decide they want to customize 2 shirts. They're newlyweds and want shirts that say "Just Married". I'm focused at this point (I got this!) and start working on the shirts. Remember, those iron press machines are hot and I have to place each vinyl letter one-by-one and ensure it's straighten and everything (while I'm stoned). Shirt 1 - done and looks good. Shirt 2 - no problem looks great, they love it, I'm all sweaty not but stoked. My fellow associates are still in the back smoking, so I'm solo during this whole mission. Anyways shirts are done so I go to ring them up. Guy wants to pay with a credit card (don't have to count change, yes!). He hands me his Visa, I ask for his I.D., all is good and I hand it back to him. I go to the credit card machine and of course I hit a road block. His card isn't swiping, I try swiping it 3 or 4 times...nothing, so now I may have to punch in the 16 digits manually. Before I do though I ask him if he has another credit card since this one isn't swiping. With a wide-eyed face he's just stares at me and says, "you've been swiping my Driver's License." I hadn't realized everyone left the room while I was talking. And I sat there for at least an hour smoking and looking at my phone having no idea that I was all by myself. 
Apparently I was so zoned out that they left without me and came back with food and everything. 
At least an hour went by I strained pasta noodles holding the strainer from the bottom.i work at a dispensary in Toronto. i had a customer come in super high and he made a huge order with many strains totalling an ounce. he was so excited..too excited. he paid more than $400 for his order. i bagged everything up and gave him his change, he gave me props and walked away briskly...so brisk that i had to literally run down the fuckin street and hand him his bag of dope and receipt. he gave me a huge hug and said that we were the best shop in town lolI decided to crisp up some leftover French fries by broiling them in the oven. Chowed down, passed out, woke up the next morning to find the broiler still going strong. 

Don't smoke and broil, kids. Just use the microwave.Tried to be inconspicuous by putting on sunglasses and tip toeing passed someone's dorm room because we forgot to invite him over to smoke. His door was open and he was facing the hallway. In high school, I left a note for my parents when they got home telling them I'd be at a friend's house for the night. The note was a page long.LSD

At a friends house, going from his living room to his bedroom in the dark.  I'd been there 100 times before, it was just one 90 degree turn to the left to end up in front of his door.

I got lost going around that corner that felt more like a never-ending spiral for what we later estimated was 45 minutes. Applied Burt's Bees lip balm to my eye lids because I thought the cooling sensation would make my eyes appear less red...big mistakeI went blind.

I was in the early days of smoking. Probably 15ish, buddy's apartment, myself, brother and a guy who'd been smoking much longer than us.

I'm being introduced to hot knives.

They load up a big one for me, serve it and I take the whole thing.

As I exhale I step back and it all hits me in a rush. I'm immediately annihilated and I can't see.

I'm *freaking*. *the fuck*. *out*.

In my head I have a panicked dialogue 'You're blind, you're fucking blind, you smoked yourself blind. Holy fuck. This is it, your life is ruined. Holy fuck, what the fuck, what the fuuuuuuck!!'

Meanwhile, outside of my head, my brother is saying 'Hey.. hey.. HEY DUMBASS!'

'Turn the lights back on.'

I'd leaned against the light switch.

I've never been so relieved.

My best friend and I had smoked upstairs in my old house and went downstairs for some snacks. We're trying to act normal with my parents in the other room. I washed an apple, she buttered an english muffin. We're eating in the kitchen when she freaks out and says "oh my god, I forgot to wash my muffin." We were both alarmed for a second and then realized you don't wash muffins and fell to the floor laughing. 

That's probably not the dumbest thing we've done while high but it was my favorite thing she's said while high. We wrote it down so we wouldn't forget. I keep that note in my purse in case of a bad day.I made a shopping list. After about a half hour of trying to think of what I needed, all I had written down was: 'already have eggs'I was starving and remembered that I had pizza rolls. I put them in the microwave and watched the timer go down 1:30 seconds. 
When I opened the microwave it was empty.  I stood there like I just witnessed a glitch in the matrix until I realized I never put the plate in thr microwave and they were still sitting frozen.  My friend was about to step on a snail and I freaked out and shoved him away from it and yelled "Don't watch the steppy!!"

Yeah I don't know. It was a mix of a lot of sentences. I was just scared for the snail.I was with my friend watching some movie, I think it was Pulp Fiction. Anyway, she had some leftovers that we were eating and we were sitting in recliners in the dark watching the movie. There was a bunch, and I'm talking about a bunch of hushpuppies and honey mustard so I was pretty happy. I kept eating but at one point I noticed it tasted super off but kept eating anyway trying to convince myself it would be good if I kept chewing. My friend ended the movie half-way because she wouldn't stop talking and once she turned the lights on I realized I had been eating her mom's fruitcake dipped in honey mustard for the last 10 minutes. 

Also this one time I was super into making turkey sandwiches while high and thought it would be perfect to keep mayo, turkey and some bread in my closet if I needed it (like an emergency sandwhich stash). I ended up forgetting about it and since I was still in high school at the time, my dad found it and made fun of me. Tried making pasta with Ragu, pesto, Parmesan, and chopped Toquitos. That was the day I learned that simply throwing a bunch of good foods together does not always make for better food.
It was also last night.Called one of my friends my own name amd didn't click for like 30 seconds why it sounded weirdSophomore year. I got high before school, came into class. I get at my desk and my friends were making motorcycle noises and in return so did I. After the fact I started laughing and put my head down. Only to look up and realize we were watching a movie, and it was a clapping noise. I started texting this girl that I was hoping to get intimate with.  I started off the conversation with "hi, how are you?" And then I hit a dab and replied " I'm alright how about you"...to my own text.Not me, but I was involved, and I was also high.


I had just waked and baked and was on my way to work at like 6:30AM right after a long weekend.  Labor Day weekend, I think it was.  Stopped by Dunkin Donuts on my way.  Ordered a coffee with a turbo shot and a sandwich.


The guy working the drive thru, not only looked like a zombie, but he did something that made me know he was obliterated.


He tells me my total, so I give him my debit card to run because I didn't have any cash on me.


He takes my card, stares at the register for a few seconds, then opens the drawer (without swiping my card) and just hands me back the total that I was supposed to pay in cash, as well as my card back.


Me, also being high and pretty tired as I hadn't had my coffee yet, just took the change and my card back.  Something seemed off about this, so then I just kind of sat there looking at what he just handed me.  Finally, it clicked for me, and I tell him, "Dude, I don't think I was supposed to receive cash back, I was trying to pay with my card."


At first he looks petrified/confused.  Then after like what had to be 10 seconds, he finally kind of grins and just goes, "Dude, I already did the sale on the register, just take it.  I fucked up."This was back around 2001 or so and I was a teenager who was stoned for the first time. I got dropped off at home and instead of going to my room, I went to the communal computer in the living room and did the only natural thing: listened to music while watching the Winamp visualizer! My older brother noticed that I was home so he came to talk to me, and I totally panicked! I thought to myself "What would sober thepriceofmalk normally do in this situation?!" So I just punched my brother in the stomach as hard as I could and turned back to the computer.My M.O. used to be going to get my laundry, forgetting the goal and walking past the laundry room, arriving in the kitchen and engaging in deep cognitive dissonance as to why I was in the kitchen. Watched Grease.  Which turns out to be the longest fucking movie ever when you're high.  I swear it felt like I had been watching it for hours and I'd look at the clock and only five minutes had passed.  All the while eating a loaf of bread out of the bag like it was popcorn.I ordered a 'medium Mcwater' after my friend (the manager at the McDonald's) offered me anything I wanted for freeFirst time I ever smoked pot was in high school, with a buddy of mine and his friend. We drove to the movies, smoked in the parking lot, and then went inside to see the first Captain America movie.

I don't remember like anything about that movie, I was spacing out like almost the entire time. I just remember this one scene, where Chris Evans is talking to some military higher-up, and the guy gives him this harsh speech about how he's never going to make it in the military, and then there's this long close-up shot of Chris Evans looking defeated. I remember my buddy turned and glanced at me while I was staring up at the screen with my mouth hanging open, and I turned and whispered to him (in complete sincerity), "I'll bet he becomes Captain America."Placed my iPhone directly into my mug of hot coffee, as nonchalantly as if I was putting it into my pocket.
Took me a solid 5 seconds of staring at it, blank-faced, before realizing what was wrong with what I was looking at, and pulling it out. Obviously the phone was toast.Someone's bike came apart near me when I was walking after smoking. Prior to this I had worked for a year assembling shitty bikes for Walmart so I thought I'd come to this person's aid. I went up to her a told her: "I repair bikes, I've got this". And after 15 minutes of taking more of the bike apart I realized that I did not, in fact got this. I stood up said: " I'm sorry, there is nothing more I can do" and left.I walked out of my friend's apartment and saw a red car, a yellow car, and a blue car parked in a row.  I then got my camera to record it because it was that interesting.  Then I put it on YouTube.
edit: I guess i removed the video, just re uploaded https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hunZzguLHUGot to the ticket desk at the airport, forgot my wallet. Drove home like a mad man, couldn't find my wallet. Found my wallet in the backpack I was bringing (wearing while at the ticket desk). Still didn't miss the flight thanks to the "get there super early" paranoia following 9/11.I don't smoke but I witnessed my brother try to pass the joint to the dog and when he obviously didn't take it he said "Max it's your turn". 

I was dying When I was a junior in highshool our english teacher told us to read 2 chapters of a book for the rest of the class that was it. 5 minutes later I turn to my buddy and whisper "psst show me your answers" room was dead silent except for our muffled laughter.  As a teenager my mom came home one day during the summer while I was completely stoned with one of my friends. He fled out the back and I went inside to try and act normal, I poured kool aid into a cereal bowl and proceeded to drink from it. I didn't realize anything was wrong until after she left, although she never said anything about it.Got high in Colorado at a speakeasy (weed lounge) while there a girl told me about how her phone was running slow. Working for a phone company I know we can clear cache (background files) and it usually speeds things up. She trusted me and passed her phone over. Instead of clearing cache I wiped her phones memory by mistake. I swiftly gave her the phone back and proceeded to tell her to wait 5 minutes then turn it on. I left and haven't been back to that speakeasy again.I quietly whispered, "Everyone knows I am high," to my buddy when we were at the store.

He said, "Dude stop yelling!"So in college we smoked a huge blunt in my off campus house and then I got the munchies BAD. So I opened a can of chef boyardee and put it on the stove. A few minutes later my roommate walks by the kitchen says "what the fuck are you doing???" as I was waving my hands over the pot to see if the raviolis were getting warm.

Not only had I been stirring cold raviolis on the stove without the flame on, but I had ordered a pizza RIGHT before smoking the blunt... This was like 10 years ago.

Decided I was going to take a summer course at the community college I attended. Environmental Geology. I can still remember it. Anyway, I lived like 30-45 minutes away, and on the first day of class I smoked a whole bowl on my way in. Yeah, I was baked.

Get to the school and I was like 30 minutes early. I like to be early to avoid embarrassing stoned moments... Well, I get there, find the classroom, pop in my earbuds on my MP3 player (before phones had them built in), and have a seat in the front row. I also like to sit in the front row.

Everyone around me was staring at me, and it felt off, but I was just going with it.

Class time roles around and in comes a teacher I knew from a previous class I had taken. He looks at me bewildered, says "TheRedOakTree? Hello, but why are you here?" I said I was waiting for Environmental Geology to start.

He says "this is Sociology 101. I think you have the wrong room." Huh... I pull out my schedule, show him "no this is the correct room." He gives me this cock-eyed look, and peered into my soul. Said "this class starts in two weeks."

Oh... and so I went home and smoked more weed.

*Ninja Edit: formatting*Was with my friends, watching a movie, and drinking a Snapple. I was reading the fun fact that's under the lid when I saw the "shake well". I had forgotten to shake my Snapple! What if it tasted 10x better if I shook it and I was missing out?! I furiously started to shake it. I still had the lid in my hand and my drink went everywhere and soaked me. 

I'm still bummed about it. RIP Snapple. 
Got super emotionally invested in an episode of Bob's Burgers and literally cried when the plot resolved itself.  I was just *so happy.*Panicked, full sprint across the house to rescue my food that was exploding in the microwave, only to end up wasting half a bag of unpopped popcorn kernelsThe 2nd doobie had gone out and my girlfriend needed the lighter, which was on my side. I was playing The Binding of Isaac at the time so when she asked for the lighter I picked up a bomb in the game and thought everything was resolved. I was super stoned painting my nails and eating a lollipop at the same time. I kept mistaking the nail polish brush for my lollipop and licked the brush 3 different times and eventually got frustrated and gave up. 
Not me but my friend. He tried putting a box of Cheez-its in the refrigerator before his mom looking puzzled stopped him and said "Steve those don't go in there".Staying in a hostel, bunch of us had been drinking/smoking. I was pretty baked and decided it would be a wise move to make my sandwiches for my work lunch the next day. Me and a mate spent half an hour chuckling away making sandwiches, giggling at the cheese slicer.

Went to work the next day, a bit worse for wear. Longest morning ever, out in the baking sun. It got to lunch time, I unwrapped my first sandwich - cheese and ham. Off to a good start. Unwrapped the second one - 2 slices of plain bread. Third one - 2 slices of plain bread and finally, the fourth one was 3 slices of plain bread and 2 grapes.

My colleagues gave me some biscuits and an apple, between laughing fits.I dumped nearly a whole bottle of perfume on myself. It was not the goal. I got it in my head that if I took off the cap, I could sort of dab the opening at my neck and get a bigger and better amount than if I just sprayed it. It didn't go well. I was in too good a mood to be worried though, so I greeted my mom with my best smile when she came to pick me and my equally high friend up. She didn't even say anything, just sort of shook her head, face palmed for a second and drove us home with the windows open. Once, I called Domino's Pizza and when they asked for my phone number, I gave them their phone number. And it was something really easy like 555-5000. The person was quiet for a second and then said "Ummm... that's OUR phone number."I tried to feed a picture of my friend's dog a cheez-itProbably not even in the top 20 dumbest, but probably worth telling.

Me and my friend were probably 21-22 or so, got real high on acid at a park, and we were doing the normal stuff like petting grass tufts like they were porcupines, cheering for baseball players that weren't there, etc. At one point we ended up back in the parking lot to fetch ball gloves out of the car or something (no we weren't planning on driving home; we had planned on driving home like 4 in the morning - was a pretty normal thing).

We were rolling around on the grass for some reason and these two girls come walking into the parking lot smoking cigarettes and started talking to us. Any attempt to communicate with them didn't go too well because of our state and we didn't really pay them much attention. Eventually the effort to try and communicate with other human beings proved too great and we went and sat in the car. It was pretty cold out and we were drawing things in our breath on the windows and stuff. I guess the doors were unlocked and after awhile the two girls opened the door, said something like "we're cold, we're coming in" and they were in the back seat. We didn't protest much because ignoring them seemed to be going well anyway, and went back to drawing things on the windows and chatting while the girls had their own conversation. 

Soon, a car comes prowling into the parking lot driving real slow like. One of the girls says to the other: "oh shit, is that your parents?".

At this point I turned around and kind of came online long enough to look at their faces for probably the first time... "um, how old are you?" I ask.  

"Thirteen. How old are you?" The car pulls up beside us.

"GET DOWN." I say, not kidding around. They duck down and the dad looks over and probably can't really see much because the windows are all fogged up. I start up the car to make it seem like I've got somewhere to be. After a few seconds he drives off, probably to prowl the neighbourhood some more for his 13 year old and her friend who absconded to the park with their stolen cigarette.

"Get out." 

They get out and leave. Me and my friend look at each other for a few minutes in stunned silence before deciding we'd better get the fuck out of there before they go home and get forced to tell they were in some stranger's car together. 

So we have a paranoid drive home and played cards all night. I dunno, maybe it wasn't that good a story. Well it's funny to us to remember it anyway, and consider how wrong it could have gone if dude had figured out his little girl was in our car and us trying to explain it on acid.

I love getting baked and doing chores around the house. Makes them pass by so quickly and happily.

One time I got super high and put on my sweet noise cancelling headphones to jam out while I was vacuuming...

Vacuumed the whole apartment, then took off my headphones only to realize I never turned on the vacuum  :-(I was about 16 and I was sneaking back up to bed after smoking all night when I got the munchies real bad. I took a detour to the kitchen and I started rifling around but I was too paranoid to turn on the lights so I really couldn't see shit. I got a craving for fruit so I went over to the fruit bowl and I saw the biggest orange I've ever seen. I'm talking massive. This thing was the size of a softball if not bigger. So I was all over it.

I took it up to my room, again too afraid to turn on the lights, so I just started peeling it blindly. I was really struggling and I even remember stopping to giggle at how I was so stupidly high I couldn't even peel an orange. Fast forward a bit and I finally take the first hard-earned bite and it was just awful. Sour and bitter and everything bad all at once. You know that feeling when you bite into something and it's just not at all what you expected? It's a special kind of disappointment. 

But instead of just throwing it away and going to sleep I fought on. I had to eat the orange. I was forcing down slice after slice, bite after bite, all the while shaming myself for not appreciating how delicious it truly was. I had convinced myself that there was nothing wrong with the orange, rather, the problem was with me. My taste buds had been warped by years of exposure to processed sugar and corn syrup and other synthetic treats. How far had I drifted from what mother nature intended? Undoubtedly some of my ancestors went their entire lives without tasting something as delicious as an orange. This was a cathartic moment for me. I deserved this suffering. It was the first step on the road to recovery. Eventually I finished and passed out.

First thing the next morning I saw my mom at the kitchen table and, still trying to convince myself, I said "Mom, those oranges are so big! And so good. Where did you get them?" And she looked at me like I was retarded and said "Sweetie, those are grapefruits."I was really pretty baked and decided to head off home, spent ten minutes trying to put on my shoes, they felt like they were tiny and a real struggle to put on. Turns out my friend, a girl had identical shoes about 6 sizes smaller than mine. Too confusing.I wanted to try weed for the first time when I was 13 in 7th grade. I decided to hit my friend up and he gave me 2 roaches for 5 bucks, hopefully it wasn't shitty weed nor a rip off.

Anyways I got home and you know, locked the door and started hitting it. I mean I got like 2-3 good hits before it started burning my finger. I sat for a good 10-15 minutes before something.. but I didn't really feel anything. I don't remember really.

I walked out of my room into my brother's room, and at the time he was with his girlfriend, now ex. She started saying I smelt like weed, like real talk. My sister wasn't defending me but she just said we got the scent of smoke from third-hand smoking, from my dad.

She was getting serious though, so I started freaking out and I ran into my room. I was so scared of getting caught and I kept panicking. I used the spray but it wasn't good enough.

I have NO idea what was going through my mind at the time, but I decided to fart. I wanted to make my room smell like shit. So I took off my pants and decided to fart, and I did so, like 2 long ones. Brother literally came into my room, I had my pants on at the moment afterwards, and he just said "It smells like shit in here"

I didn't get caught. Walked to a store with my brother to by snacks, I got in the door immediately forgetting why I went in. So to cover up being there and not knowing why, I decide "better buy these snacks so he does get suspicious". We got back to my house and I realized I accidentally did what I meant to do. Eaten an entire box of Lucky Charms in one sitting.We asked a buddy of mine to order a pizza after we all got baked. 
Twenty minutes later, we ask where the pizza is, and all he says was "oh crap... I accidentally bought an exercise bike instead... My bad guys.."

Few days later, he sends me a snapchat petaling on that same bikeA long time ago, I drove to a super ghetto Walmart in a really shitty area while stoned. Went shopping for like 20-30 minutes, came back to find my car was unlocked, keys were in the ignition, and the car was on. Not my best moment.Best Story:  I was at a concert at the Meadowlands in NJ.  I forget what the concert was, but one where a ton of people were tailgating in the parking lot in the summer.  Suffice it to say, we had a lot to drink, and a ton to smoke.  We decided to pack it in, and head into the show.  Of course, we wanted to bring our bowl and some weed.  Figuring out how to sneak this in though was the hard part..  so, being high, we came up with a plan.  My buddy stuck the bowl down his pants into his crotch area.  I put the weed into a film canister (this is back in the 90's).  

So, we walked in and got patted down.  I went through and held the film canister in my hand, when they searched me, they asked me to put my hands up, and they ran a wand/patted me down.  They never bothered to check what was actually in my hands.  Worked great.  My buddy got through also with the bowl in his pants.  

Nows the funny part..  As we walk in, behind the gate, was a NJ state trooper parked watching as people came through security.  Basically, you went through security, and then needed to walk past the cop car.  So, the 3 of us walked by the cop car, and then all of the sudden my buddy stopped, and was like 'The bowl fell out of my pants, it's in front of the cop car.'.  At this point, we peer pressured him in to going and getting it.  So, he walks in front of the cop car, walks around for a bit, trys to look 'normal' (keep in mind, we are all high as fuck).  He gets down on one knee and pretends to tie his shoe, and picks up the bowl.  

He walks back to the two of us and we are giving each other high fives.  I talk to my other buddy who was there and he goes 'Dude, the cop was watching you the whole time, he saw the bowl, and was laughing his ass off.'.  A cool NJ State Trooper. :)

tl;dr: a NJ state trooper saw us drop weed and try to pick it back up at a concert, we thought we were super spys, he laughed his ass off.  Smoked a couple backwoods with some friends and then started to drive home. I come up to this one light that's red, and because i was turning right I pull up behind some cars who are also waiting to turn right. I'm jamming out to some Borgore in the right turn lane when I notice that the light has gone green, red, and green again and I still haven't moved an inch. So I'm sitting here going wtf until I realize that I am not in a right turn lane, but am instead pulled over behind several parked cars. Lol, the worst part is I turn right at this light everyday after school...Popped virtual bubble wrap for an hour. Does shrooms count? I went "for a walk" for 3 hours and when I came back fell asleep on the couch. Woke up to my roommate asking me where the fuck I got all the Easter decorations from.This one time a friend of mine and I were relaxing and listening to music inside his parked car (1994 honda civic); we were talking and he suddenly jolted the fuck out of his car seat and shushed me... we don't move for like 5 seconds, and then the conversation happens like this:

Me: *what is it?*

Him: (in all seriousness and looking scared as fuck) *I felt the car starting!*

Me: (worried) *It starts by itself?*

After that incident I don't remember having laughed so hard and for so long EVER in my life. I honestly thought I was gonna die of asphyxia or break a rib. We laughed our asses off like 20 minutes straight at the top our lungs. 

Edit: Ok for a couple of folks asking I think I need to add some more context: The car had been off the whole time. We had been sitting there, seats reclined, just listening to music and smoking for maybe an hour... And this fucking idiot "felt" (god knows how) that the car started the engine all by itself out of nowhere. This was the first time my mom caught me being high as a kid. I was at the computer with a cup of almonds playing some quality TBC world of Warcraft. Mom comes home and asks for help with the groceries, no problem I got this. I help her, look for my almonds, and return back to my post. Next thing I know I'm sticking my hand in a cup full of Coca Cola and I shout "FUCK THESE AREN'T MY NUTS!". We locked eyes, and she knew immediately I'd just got back in, high as hell and crashed in my bed. It felt like I'd been lying there for hours thinking, I got out of bed and told my room mate I was sorry I'd been gone so long. It'd been about 5 minutes.I smoked often while bussing tables in a fine dining restaurant. One morning as I was pouring some older folks' waters, I thought about my usual "your server will be right out" line that I typically said once done filling their glasses. My mind wandered to thinking that it's best I say server instead of waiter or waitress for the same reason they're called flight attendants now, not stewardesses. Then I started wondering what the reason was for getting rid of the word stewardess. Anywho, I finished pouring their waters and said "your flight attendant will be right out." It was the only moment I ever actually thought and believed the customers knew I was high. I took a racoon mask, put it under my hoodie and ran down a street. I breathed too much, fogged up the eye holes and ran into a car. Pretty funI once decided it would be hilarious to roll all the way down this really steep, grassy hill.  I forgot I had a glass bottle of orange juice in my jacket pocket. By the time I reached the bottom I had a pocket full of broken glass and was soaked in blood and orange juice.I've been smoking for a long time. I like to think I don't do too much stupid shit anymore, but one thing I will always be an idiot about is eating.  I eat and eat and eat. Whether I'm hungry or full, no matter how late it is, I eat like The Lost Boys from the movie Hook.  I eat combinations of food that don't make any sense. Cheerios and salsa? What the fuck?  I eat until I regret it, and later or the next morning I can be in a considerable amount of discomfort.  

One evening i was on a vinegar kick, crushing pickles and olives, salt and vinegar chips, fries and ketchup. I got bad heartburn and drank some baking soda solution to neutralize it, making my stomach a 5th grade science fair volcano. The gas from the chemical reaction stretched my flabby gut as tight as a drum, and I laid around wallowing in mild but unpleasant pain and regret. I went to McDonald's and I asked for three McDonald's Another time friend and I were going fishing. Smoked a joint before we stopped for smokes, snacks, and drinks. Walked into local gas station, bought my goods, thanked the nice lady behind the counter, and looked her right in the eye and FARTED thunderous loud. Walked out and left my buddy, who was behind me in line, to deal with what just went down. The look on his face when he came out was etched into memory forever. Still cracks me up 20 years later. I went to tacobell with some friends after blazing and ordered some tasty empanadas. After placing my order I decided to scan the room for a place to sit. I visually located a booth big enough for our party behind two grandparents and their young grandchild (maybe 8-ish). 

I remember thinking how sweet and kind it was for these old folks to take their grandson out for some food and how loving it was. I turned to calmly tell my friends that I was going to sit behind that loving family. They all turn and looked at me confused. So I repeated it and this time pointed my finger to indicate where it was I was going to sit. 

It was at this moment I realize how far away I am from the counter and how close this loving family was to me. I also realized how loud I was yelling. Turns out I was standing right beside their table with my finger in the grandpa's face and I'm yelling at the top of my lungs about how I'm going to sit behind this loveing family. 

I then become rigid with fear and embarrassment and robot speed walk out of there and sit in my car while my friends sit at the booth and enjoy their food. They did bring me my empanadas so... Win?1) Set pizza slice on ground to show my friends I can still do a kickflip when I'm stoned. Where I sat the slice down was dirt, there was a table less than 5 feet away... Did the kickflip, picked up the slice and brushed off the top a little bit before eating. 

2) Friends and I get baked and drive to a Wendy's for food. This was one of the places that had a pay window separate from the pickup window. We pay, then started driving home. 15 minutes later one of my friends ask where the food was, and it took us a minute to realize we never picked up our food. We drove back to the drive-thru and said "hey, we uhh... paid for food and forgot to pick it up...", there was some laughter and they knew who we were. They gave us our food and it had a couple extra things of fries added in. Respect. Confessed to having weed in my car. Actually happened recently, my court date is three weeks away for possession in florida. If anyone has any advice please help thanks.Smashed a couple of windows to escape Voldemort after calling the cops...  
I took some kind of pill when I was drunk that I had no idea what was and my memory shortly after is blank. I woke up many hours later in my own puke in a bathroom at the venue where I had attended a birthday party, and everyone had left and I was looked in. I was completely paranoid and 100% certain that Voldemort was somewhere in the building coming to kill me.  
I called the cops and told them I was looked in a building with Voldemort and needed help, the dispatcher said they would send a car. But before they arrived my paranoia took overhand and I smashed a couple of windows and escaped the building.My brother and I searched for my friend... while said friend helped us look.My friend went to the store but left his phone at the house because he had a playlist playing for everyone. We wanted to get in and change a song but didn't know the password. So, I proceed to call his cellphone to ask him what his password was. When his phone started ringing, I just face palmed while everyone else started laughing at me.

My wife is very happy we both abstained until we got married.


I'm happy I lied about being a virgin. [deleted]My husband and I waited until we were married to have sex. We were both virgins on our wedding night. We didn't have any difficulty consummating the marriage, we were both very anxious and ready. Our marriage (9 years now) has had some ups and downs. We've got 3 kids, and - I feel - a very healthy, satisfying sex life. We didn't get outside much on our honeymoon. Now, 9 years later, we don't regret our decision to abstain. I have no basis for comparing our sexual relationship, but we both have fun, and find the frequency and quality of our sex life to be very good.It was very underwhelming and not worth the wait at all. We were married 8 years before the dick-wrinkle cheated on me with the neighbors wife. Our whole marriage I thought "I don't really like sex"...turns out he was just awful. I LOVE sex! Now that we're divorced my sex life is much better.I found out she was a guy the entire time :cDidn't exactly wait till after marriage but my wife and I have only been with each other. Though we got married 4 months after knowing each other. 

I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. My wife is open to try new things [we watch porn together for inspiration sometimes] so it's not like I'm stuck doing the same thing over and over again. 

I like sharing that awkward first time memory with her. Something special we can look back on. Of course.Making a duck face. Being a pall bearer.Crying while eating junk food

No Bye, no time set for the meeting, no details at all. True Detective, when Marty's wife comes over Rust's house to cheat on him and Rust goes full on rape modeBasically anything relationship based. It's exaggerated and everything goes wrong and it all comes together eventually (in movies) or possible blows up (in TV shows over several episodes). There's always some misunderstanding that can be solved by just TALKING TO THE OTHER PERSON but they don't do that. As a result people don't bother ever talking things out with their SO's (see /r/relationships, there's a common theme of people just needing to talk to their partners or family or whatever) and it's like... stop learning all about relationships from TV and just BE in the relationship, hash things out and if things aren't going to be fixed or overcome then call it a day. Don't stick around thinking that things will change, MAKE the change yourself and just get out of the situation that's making you/made you miserable for months or years.

See, my first thought was "I'd master poker so I could go down to the casino and win me some retirement."  And that's great, but let's expand our scope a little bit.  By being a flawless liar, all you need to succeed in poker is a bit of time pouring over books on probability.  Maybe a little practice, but you've certainly still got a massive edge on other casuals.

I could forge a perfect resume and just learn on the job until I could be honest about my abilities.  I could turn to a life of crime and become the greatest social engineer the world has ever seen.  I could become a master of disguise.  The possibilities are endless.Memorization Steph Curry's shot. Math, if you include all math that exists even if people haven't worked it out yet.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*Freshman year of college, I discovered that if you had credits on your swipe-able ID card, you could use it as a credit card on any soda machine on campus. I was buying a soda once and I clicked the wrong one by accident. I held the cancel button, and then clicked the soda I wanted. Let go of both buttons and it came out without charging my account. I checked my purchase history and there was no record of a purchase being made. Fast forward 6 months later, I returned every left over bottle at a supermarket and got $13.75. 

Then I realized I didn't want to get caught, so I stopped. 

Edit: The school definitely caught on, because they replaced every single vending machine on campus my sophomore year. Or perhaps it was just coincidence. I discovered at a Renaissance Faire that they had souvenir tin mugs for beer. I had a mug that looked deceptively similar but actually held two pints instead of one (increased diameter is tricky like that). At least half the places filled it without question, and only charged for one pint.I used to work at a bagel store that had a punch card: buy 12 dozen bagels and get the 13th free.  We used a "B" shaped hole punch.   Another restaurant chain - Baker's Square - had a similar program: buy 12 pies, get the 13th free.  They also used a "B" shaped hole punch.  After eating a meal at Baker's Square, we got a few of their cards and started punching "B" shaped holes using our bagel store hole punch.   

So here we were... an 18 year old girl and 21 year old guy driving around Minneapolis to different Baker's Square restaurants claiming to have eaten 12 pies and we were ready for our free 13th. 

Baker's Square went bankrupt and out of business a couple years later, and it's all our fault.There this nearby Subway that's really busy during certain hours because of all the college students.

Going during those times means super long lines, but that means they're so busy you can get away with doubling up on less noticeable things like cheese or bacon, or get avocado, and they'll forget to charge it.This semester the hood of my car flew up on the freeway and smashed the windshield.  Easy fix, but along with the windshield went the parking decal for my school, and I had to use the per-day visitor permits for the rest of the semester.  The way the one day parking works, theres a few machines in the parking lot that you drive up to and for $1 you get 4 hours of parking, or for $2 you can get all day parking.  For the all day parking though, instead of issuing a single ticket for the whole day, it just issues two 4 hour tickets that you're supposed to display on your dashboard.  About a week in I realised I could just pay for 4 hours, and stack an old permit under it with the time stamp hidden.  Campus security never penalizes anyone for stacking them like that even though the terms say both time stamps need to be visible.Walmart flyers advertised a newish videogame for $20 but when you got to the store the doors where covered in signs saying that it was the walkthrough that was reduced. So I took my flyer to Future Shop next door and had them do a price match for me.No. And it doesn't.

Edit: I was wrong. PLEASE LOVE ME!!!Everyone cares about what at least one person thinks. That's just life. Anyone who goes through and says otherwise, probably has had rough experiences with people they trusted and its fair for them to want to think that, but it won't happen. It might be hard for them to trust someone, but even they will care about what people think. The ones who care the most, seemingly can be and are those who repeatedly say "I don't care what anyone thinks/ I don't need anyone/ it's just me vs everyone"  stuff along those lines. No one is meant to go through life alone, whether you believe on religion or not, thats just the case. Anyone who is self made, needed help to get to there they were at. 

As for as who I care about, when it comes to what they think of me? Immediate family. Girlfriend. And boss. The last might seem out of place, but she is the one that can make me become unemployed. Luckily I work at a place where being yourslef (I'm a jokester) is actually sought after. 

As far as it affecting my decisions? It just helps me for the most part, do things I know I wouldn't want to/shouldn't do. One thing I do, do even though I wouldn't let anyone know, is speed. I care that they don't want me to. But i like to get where I'm going. But I don't weave through traffic, just occupy the left lane passing everyone doing a decent velocity until i reach my exit



Edit: see?  Crystal said no, then changed the tune =) 

Sorry for the wall of text, but just wanted to make sure what I said came off correctly. Apart from a few people that matter to me, I really don't care about other's opinions. 
You know what the trick is to not care? 

SIMPLY STOP GIVING A FUCK! 

It's easy, actually. Of course, I care what people think of me - even people I don't like. Not because I want their friendship or anything like that, but because I want something from them. People are more likely to give me what I want if they think there is some kind of mutual respect going on. Of course I care. People who say they "don't give a fuck about other people's opinions" and that it's easy to do are liars and doing it wrong.  

Firstly, it isn't easy at all to properly stop giving a fuck.  

Secondly, it's the wrong and negative way to interpret what it means to "not care" what people think of you.     

There's a difference between not caring what people think as in "I'm comfortable with myself and like myself, and if someone has an opinion on it or me then that's cool" and "I don't give a FUCK about what people think, fuck them all."  

For some reason this kind of question is always nearly interpreted as the latter. The latter is fake in my opinion and projecting. People like the latter do give a fuck. I can guarantee it.I used to. But being old and having weathered life ending shit, I really don't care any more. I do what I do.There are four people that I care what they think of me: my girlfriend, my boss, my boss's boss, and my grandma. Can't upset grandma.To an extent. 99% of people I come across on a daily basis i could care less. It's that 1% that matter. Family, friends, employers, and whatnot. I truly care wholeheartedly what my SO, her family, my family and my boss think about me. Everyone else can go to hell. 

I ultimately have been making decisions that make me seem like a more well adjusted adult when 99% of the time all i want to do is pay my bills and spend the rest of my paycheck on groceries and pot and spend my time gardening or playing videogames, but since i'm no longer a POS and have a family to care for, I make better decisions. I work harder and longer hours to provide a good life for my SO and our pets. I buy healthier foods and cook more instead of ordering delivery each night like I used to when I lived alone. I don't smoke copious amounts of pot or cigarettes or spend my days off in my underwear watching tv and playing videogames. I try to be a better person for them because i know that they're trying for me as well. I know for a fact my SO is home right now, in bed sleeping ready to wake up at 5 am to go to work extra hours when all she wanted to do tonight was stay up late with her best friend, watch reality tv and go out for a beer. 

But, if i'm going down the street and stop at a restaurant and decide to go for the fattiest, biggest, cheese covered burger over some fancy, small, politically correct food I will and any judgmental looks are returned with a smile. I won't be an asshole about it, but I will politely ask you to mind your own.No. I only care what my secret crush thinks of me.IMO, everyone cares to some extent what others think of them. It's so important to at least take the perception of others into consideration, but not let it ultimately make decisions for you.I'm drunk so fuck it. My entire life I've been the"left over" friend. In other words,  everyone finds a mate and I'm stuck with the gimpy,  autistic,  cleft lipped friend.  And if I in any way say,  "No thanks,  I'm not interested" than I'm a superficial prick. If I bring up that none of my friends would date any of these women I get a look of pity.  Like this is all I deserve,  and if I ask for more I'm pulling outside of my realm and being too superficial.  So I eventually just understand that I'll be alone and honestly,  I'm fine with it.  And what happens?  Everyone constantly implies why me being alone is sad.  Fucking hypocrites. The only people that I care what they think is my family. Outside of that, I consider others' opinions exactly zero times when making a decision.I try not to care but my brain wants to anyways. It's getting less of an issue though.No. If it did, I wouldn't be able to pursue my happiness.

I'm a crossdresser. I'm a guy and identify as one, but dressing female, wearing makeup and just generally making myself look feminine is something that I love.  A lot of people are judgmental and negative.  I've learned to ignore them.

I've learned to love what I do and love who I am.  Now, some people's opinions do matter, like my customers. But fortunately, it's that the more they see me as a convincing crossdresser and dancer, the more they approve of me. This helps drive me and I can use their opinions to help push myself in what I love. http://pics.blameitonthevoices.com/102010/hide_the_poo.jpg[*shudders*](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120216185514AAvCCcp)[ok listen my brother andrew is very very skilled](http://66.media.tumblr.com/cc3f82dce82727727a988fd31a71908d/tumblr_nqttaoSqpF1r04s8fo1_1280.png)[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/gcnlAZ1/) one always makes me laugh.[Has anyone ever been far as...](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100225111311AAozUMa)[How is babby formed?](https://youtu.be/w_RaPOOVX1Y)I think everything on that site is strange; its a hive of pure cringe.

And then we'd need an easy way to get pull it all down if/when it gets cold enough.  The solar energy from space angle would help here, too.

Dave Chapelle made a good joke on it during standup if someone remembers. Pee-wee HermanThe human spirit.I think God was a little hard on Lucifer.Lance ArmstrongAndrew JacksonI remember two times as a young child when I was horrified by a kids' movie.
1) James and the Giant Peach. That whole scene with the freaky ritual and then the scene with his going into the peach scared me so badly that I had to leave the theater.
2) There was a Disney short that had a fun, goofy whale being chased by some mean but goofy and inept whalers. I enjoyed watching their mishaps until they KILLED AND ATE THE WHALE. I remember blubbering, "I thought the whale was the good guy!"This was not actually a scene that frightened me, but as an adult, my dad told me he used to worry about a scene in The Little Mermaid.  You know when she rescues Eric from the sinking ship and then her friends bring the statue of him to her secret treasure trove...but then Sebastian tells her dad?  The part where he goes ballistic and uses his spear to destroy all of her belongings really bothered my father.  He told me just a couple of years ago that he always wondered if that scared me or made me think he might do something similar.  I told him, no, not at all!  But I thought it was interesting that it actually made him anxious, as a parent.I always thought Pink Elephants on Parade from Dumbo was pretty scaryThe whole Brave Little Toaster is scarring.

I get that the original poem itself was a bit messed up, but actually personifing the oysters that gotten eaten into cute babies made it extra disturbing. 

See comment below for actual scene, I linked extra weirdness by accident. 
Two kids movies come to mind: 
Thumbelina (1994)... The frog that tries to kiss her gave me the creeps... 
Fern Gully's villain, Hexxus is a trip  Everyone mentions the Wheelies in Return to Oz, but no one ever talks about the fact that at the beginning, they were going to give the little girl (Dorothy?) electroshock therapy to get rid of her delusions of Oz.  That totally freaked me out.I'm surprised I haven't seen Coraline in here. I've heard it described as a movie that adults will find disturbing, but kids don't notice.

The first time I saw it, I didn't think anything was wrong, but the second time, I realized how creepy it was, so I guess that's when I grew up.

I'm trying to think of a scene that exemplifies it's creepiness, But I think it's that each component of the other world is first presented as a happy-go-lucky wonderland, but then the trap is revealed, and everything gets creepy and starts falling apart at the seams (pun very much intended).The boat scene in Willy Wonka is legit disturbing.The wheelers in Return to Oz have always freaked me the hell out: https://youtu.be/2MLVfQOknYM Fantasia was considered a kids movie. A night on bald mountain was pretty nightmare inducing.My parents recorded a sex tape over our recording of Space Camp on VHS.   Right in the middle of it.

Not because it's violent (it isn't), but it's practically Hell on earth in a Disney movie. I still can't believe they went that far - Jessie having to stop Bullseye from struggling against the trash and accepting their fate, everyone holding hands in defeat, that long shot of them staring into the inferno... and then they follow it up with one of the best long-term payoffs to a joke in any trilogy.

Edit: Music to hit you hard in the feels - [The Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt5Fd6MISZU)The scene at the end of "We're Back" where Professor Screweyes is covered by crows and eaten, leaving only his fake eye behind. It disturbed me as a kid and the darkness in that one scene still disturbs me: Ariel the Little Mermaid: King Triton discovering her hidden cache of human items and just going so over the top with destroying everything. The way they did a close up on his face.. it was disturbing and intimidating and I felt so sorry for Ariel and even as a adult I still do. That one act sent her straight to Ursula and then brought the other problems in the movie forward. King Triton's fears and actions shoved his daughter into Ursula's manipulations.

Edit: because spelling is important and my phone is small.I saw Simba lose his father. That devastated me.I don't care how many people say otherwise, E.T. is not a kids movie.Superman 3, the part where the giant computer sucks that woman inside. It's all sorted by the end, but that scene where she's screaming for help while slowly being dragged inside terrified me.Large MargeWhen I was a kid, I couldn't even watch the commercial advertisements for Beetlejuice. Michael Keaton scared me so much, and at one point I believe his head spun around. I was not having that. I think I may have even had to come home from a sleepover because they were going to watch it and I lost my shit. To this day, I've still never seen it. [Tim Burton's Hansel and Gretel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAbAd4QBL1s) which only aired once on the Disney Channel in 1982.

I mean just [look at this](http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2014/06/18/Tim_Burton_Hansel_Gretel_gingerbread.png.CROP.promo-mediumlarge.png) to get an idea of how disturbing some of the characters are.The kids being caged and turned into donkeys in Pinocchio.

Damn near traumatized me as a kid.

Winnie the pooh and the blustery day used to scare the shit out of me. esp the part with the teapots singing "beware! beware! beware!" of the heffalumps and woozles. I wasn't even scared of the heffalumps and woozles.I have to say, the bit in 101 Dalmations where the two goons and Cruella are discussing how to kill and skin the puppies is pretty dark. Or the car chase scene in the same movie.Watership Down.  No specific scene, the whole movie.In Antz theirs the whole battlefield scene and then they kill the Yellow Jacket's Wife that was pretty sad, but then I grew up and realized yellow jackets are very mean. But I still feel really badThe song in The Brave Little Toaster where all the cars sing about their miserable lives and allow themselves to be crushed: [Worthless](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=FqT2uOa1-d0).What about that scene in All Dogs Go To Heaven where Charlie dreams of going to Hell?Every single scene in Monster House that movie messed me up.The Witches, the film of Roald Dahl's book. I loved it as a kid but I watch it now and think, jeeesus! This is quite dark! The Grand High Witch![Watership Down](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078480/). The whole movie. All of it. The guards chanting outside the witch's castle in The Wizard of Oz. That scene gave me nightmares for a long time.Bambi's mother getting killed. Other than the boat through the tunnel in the original Willy Wonka movie?I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Pretty much the whole of Return to Oz.  Fucking wheelers, man.  I can still hear their laughs in my head.  And oh my God, when the queen was headless and going through all the glass cabinets full of heads...that movie is fucking creepy!The whole NeverEnding Story things is creepy.Anakin killing all the little JedisI don't really know, to be honest, a lot of scenes that seem innocent as a child look really weird as an adult. Recently though I would say the scene from Zootopia where they end up at nudist spa is somewhat disturbing (The movie is brilliant though, would definitely recommend seeing it if you haven't already).Little late and obscure, but the mysterious stranger from The Adventures of Mark Twain is quite an existential doozy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpaRouocBesSloth from the goonies freaked me the fuck out at first, but by the end of the movie i loved him.How To Train Your Dragon 2: the part where Drago controls Toothless and everything goes horribly, horribly wrong. That was just fucked up.All the torture in Home Alone.[This face](https://mysailingdreams.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/snow-white-disneyscreencaps_com-8110.jpg)Already talked about those The Rescuers' devil woman?

Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.

She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.

Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns."In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort." - J.R.R.

It's not nearly as flat and uninteresting as people think. There's a hill just two hours' drive from where I am right now. American here. In our country, the South is believed (rightly) to harbor more racism, less education, more religion, and less income.

The Northwest- the part also known as New England, is supposed to be stuck-up, bland, highly educated.

The West is still popularly believed to be full of cowboys. Maybe it still is. 

My own area, near Chicago, is famous for its gangsters. Al Capone is still probably our most famous citizen. We are also famous for political corruption. In the state (Illinois) 4 out of the last 7 governors have gone to jail. And it's not looking good for the current one. 

Everyone believes that the people in California are all crazy. AS they say "The kids are on drugs and the adults are on roller skates."

Canadians are very polite and say "Eh?" a lot.

The English are smarter than us. I am in Texas. It's one big distinct stereotype. By "western", do you mean earth or America? California here, I don't have an answer to your question. I was trying to think of one while blazing a fatty with all my celebrity friends at the beach. Sorry I couldn't be more help, peace brah.Well I'm living in a town in Canada right now. Obviously there's the Canadian stereotype of being overly polite. Like literally, if I walk around the corner and bump into somebody we both say "sorry". Whenever I have pancakes or waffles or similar, it's maple syrup or bust. It snowed last month too. Yes, April. 

More locally, there's a catholic high school in this town. The stuff I hear from there is just... I dunno what to think. I heard they had a school dance a year or so ago and it was broken up when it was found there were two people having sex right there in the school dance. Not like in a washroom or anything, like on the dancefloor. Like, was the girl wearing panties, she was grinding on the guy, and his dick just came out of his jeans or something? Fuck man, I don't know. 

As well, I haven't confirmed it but I heard that high school also has the highest rate of marijuana use in the local catholic school board.

"For is there any practice less selfish, any labor less alienated, any time less wasted, than preparing something delicious and nourishing for people you love?" -Michael Pollan

"According to the cooking hypothesis, the advent of cooked food altered the course of human evolution. By providing our forebears with a more energy-dense and easy-to-digest diet, it allowed our brains to grow bigger (brains being notorious energy guzzlers) and our guts to shrink. It seems that raw food takes much more time and energy to chew and digest, which is why other primates our size carry around substantially larger digestive tracts and spend many more of their waking hours chewing as much as six hours a day." -Michael Pollan

I feel like he actually has a fairly complicated character. One that seems pompous and entitled and wants to be seen as an adult yet is still a child and really is afraid of the situation he is in. I'd love to read the series or watch movies based on his perspective since he's usually an integral character in each movie or book with the exception of the first. He isn't really much in the first book. But I'd still love to see that. 

On another note along the same lines, I'd love to know how the series would go about if Neville had been chosen by Voldemort instead of Harry. I've always been a fan of Neville and seeing that perspective if he had been the chosen one/boy who lived would have been really interesting.

I've had professors that are brilliant in their field, but they can't explain any of it worth two shits. My calculus I teacher was doing side research on four dimensional shapes, but he taught limits and derivatives by making us memorize the textbook's written definitions (like only words, no equation/math) which were themselves written like hyper-dense garbage.

I always thought you needed to take classes for certification, even with a doctorate. This is not the case. (in the US at least)What an episiotomy is.That my grandma told my granddad to go lay down while she got ready to take him to the hospital when he said he felt lightheaded and tingly. Apparently she needed to look her Sunday best to take the man to the ER, and calling 911 was apparently not an option? He passed while she was in the shower. Her need to not be seen as a frumpy old woman in public most likely cost him his life. He'd been a repeat member of the zipper club in recent years, so suffice to say his ticker wasn't exactly something any sane person would have taken a risk on.

At twelve, because I was curious about my bio dad I kept asking about him for a week before she finally took me aside and told me the truth: they were just friends, he had walked her home one night after drinking, she said goodnight and went up to her room. He snuck in after her and raped her while she was unconscious.

She finished by telling me I wasn't conceived in love. She really didn't need to say that part, but it at least explained why she always treated me differently from my half sister.

Ignorance is bliss. I was way happier thinking Santa Claus was real. When my dog died a lot of people shared a bunch of shitty, sad pet death stories. Some of them were fucking awful. Some people made me sadder or angrier because they kept their pets alive too long and made them suffer because they could say good bye. Some people were too cheap or too lazy to give them the care they needed
Whatever it was-i was OK to hear "I'm sorry" and not a 20 minute depressing spiel about their pets passing (when I simply said my boy passed away).

I finished in 20min and would bum around for the other 39 before returning back. Unit officer saw this and was most displeased. Changed the rule to reporting back immediately after lunch. I hung around at the lunch table, eating really slowly for almost a full hour after that.No "unnatural" dyed hair in highschool. My senior and junior year I bleached my hair and would change my hair color every few weeks, pink, purple, green etc.

The rule was added for the school year after I graduated. First person suspended for it? My sister. I work with kids and sometimes we play fireball (solo dodgeball). I made a rule entitled the James rule because in dodgeball head shots don't count as an out. James would always lead with his face so he could never get out. Hence why I made the James rule of if you are purposely trying to get yourself hit in the face you are out A few years back in middle school, my mom signed me up for some after-school programming thing. A few of my friends were there too, but most of the people were new to programming. Most classes were spent being taught things we had been taught before. Friends and I finished the assignments in like 20 minutes (hour long class) and played coolmath and watched youtube the rest of the time. High school kids taught the class, but a teacher had to be in the room regulating stuff (for a reason I don't know, they never taught anything). Teacher sat in the back row, and saw that we were doing this, thought we hadn't done our work. One of us, who was a snorer, started fucking sleeping for some reason. She told the guys teaching the club. Basically, we made it so that there would have to be a rule that the guys teaching the class would have to walk around and see if everyone was doing their work, and to keep us busy, gave kids (like us) that were already finished homework assignments to start in class. So we had to work really slowly on easy stuff while trying not to fall asleep.* Safety vests have to be worn while outside dealing with FedEx drivers. 
* Kingpin locks are forbidden; glad hand locks now have to be used. 
* Loaded trailers must leave in a first filled, first out order. (You'd think that would be obvious, but no, we had trailers sit in our yard for 3 days while ones we just filled were leaving.)
* Step stools must be used when stepping up into drop-frame trailers.
* Pallets cannot be shrink wrapped while walking backwards.No cement in school.There's now a "no picking up the furniture" rule at a local escape room place. I went full meathead and picked up a dresser and the final key fell out of it. Don't tell me to escape if you don't mean it!Not me, but this story is too great to pass up.

So when I was in 7th grade, we had a holiday party before winter break began. We got candy canes, and two kids started sharpening them into points.

This kid, who will be referred to as Nathan, cut his tongue on his candy cane. Nathan then began sword-fighting with his friend Tyler with the candy canes.

Nathan stabbed Tyler in the arm with the candy cane. It caused a miniscule prick of blood. Long story short, Nathan's blood from his tongue was still on the tip of the candy cane, and enough of it had managed to get into Tyler's cut that he ended up having to go to the hospital.

Candy canes were subsequently banned.In high school I did a "net send * suck my balls" which ended up going to every computer in our school district.  Let's just say batch files and the command prompt were properly locked down after that. No Mohawks at work. And I don't even have a Mohawk.At my old job (restaurant), I would feed a stray cat all the time, but I could never catch her to take her home. Well, she was pregnant and gave birth. 

Well... Eventually there were a lot of stray cats hanging out so, my job called animal control and made it a rule that no one could feed any stray animals and must report a stray.

:(No scissors in the bike shop. I don't understand why they got all picky, he didn't die...Rules about how to not experiment on children (or end the practice), as well as when laws and rules can be broken for social justice.I have an aunt who I stayed with every weekend through high school and she's kinda got this "no coming in stumbling drunk and puking" type rule now.
I don't drink so much anymore though so there's that My friends and I, in high school, had bought a toaster at a nearby yard sale and brought it in. We set up shop in the downstairs locker corridor, having purchased a bag of sliced bread.

For a brief time we were the kings of toast, providing toast to all who desired. People could bring their own condiments.

Anyways, I don't know what the rule was verbatim, but soon after we weren't allowed to plug in electronic cooking devices in the hallways.

Our reign had ended.
Don't eat plants you find in the woods. no red wine in the living room. this rule actually only applies to me. Our grade 12 art class got to go to Florida as a first time pilot field trip to visit Disneyworld and go behind the scenes and watch the animators work. We were the first and last class to be given this opportunity. We flew out from Toronto with an ounce of weed hidden inside the soles of two shoes, 20 hits of acid in a cigarette pack, and a gram of hash on the back of a carefully placed penny. Once we hit the ground, the four teachers chaperoning our group of ~40 could do nothing to contain us. Someone had a fake ID and bought a shit ton of booze, we got so wasted and so fucked up and got so many warnings from the hotel we were staying in that the school officially decided there would be no more field trips to the happiest place on earth. Btw, this was 1997 and airline security was incredibly lax back then; I even remember one of our teachers telling my buddy who was holding the hash and LSD to take his potleaf hat off right before going through security in Toronto.One day Math class finished early, so me and some started playing Crazy 8's, and this other student, who flipped out when he lost last time, joined us. Halfway through the game, he started to get loud, and I had a headache, and I sarcastically said I'd pay him $50 if he could make it through the game without flipping out. He made it, and as the bell rang, he demanded his $50. However, all I had in my wallet was a penny, so I gave him that. He whipped it at the back of my head like a shuriken, shouted "YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME 50 FUCKING DOLLARS YOU PIECE OF SHIT!", picked stuff up off the teacher's desk and started throwing it at us, and me and my other buddy darted out the door as the teacher's mug of pencils impacted the wall beside us. And then, the supervisor got mad at us for darting out the door, and demanded we come back and walk out 'properly', and banned Crazy 8's. We could still play Uno and Blackjack though. The other student never got in trouble.At a company called Teletech the dress code specifically states: No golf pants.  I've only owned one pair, and only worn them once, and that was enough to change the dress code.  Golf pants look hideous with a plaid shirt and a tie.Anyone remember Science Olympiad? 20+ years ago I competed in that when I was in high school. 

There was this "build a Rube Goldberg type device" to do a simple task event.

A mommy bunny had a baby bunny there a few years back and now it seems to be the place to have baby bunnies. An employee kept chasing the poor thing when it would come out of its bush or whatever it was hiding in. They have to rope off that corner of the courtyard during the spring so the poor animals can have their peace.**tl;dr** *Bought booze for an underage Marine who got in trouble for it.  May have been the reason the majority of the Marine Corps has a roving watch on every deck of their barracks currently.*  
  
This was while I was in the Marine Corps, 2006-2010.  
My unit had just returned from deployment, and in the barracks I was roomed with a guy who was under 21 at the time.  I agreed to buy him some tequila, even though I knew better.  Later that evening, he got into an argument with a brand-new boot (new guy) who was running his mouth, and ended up decking him and knocking him out.  My roommate got in trouble, got put on restriction, but never ratted me out.  Our CO, who had given us permission to have hard-A in our rooms when the current standard was a six-pack or bottle of wine per over-21 Marine, ordered no alcohol in our barracks.  He also ordered that doors would remain open during working hours, and there would be a roving watch on every deck at all times, in addition to the usual duty NCO & his assistant duty.  
Eventually the "dry barracks" and open doors went away, but the roving watches never did.  I few months later I was transferred to a different part of the regiment to be a marksmanship instructor, which included moving to the regimental barracks.  On my first duty day, I found out they also had the roving watches.  Upon asking why, they said it was a new thing most of the battalions had been doing in the last few months.  Cut to me being out of the Corps, but keeping up with friends still in, as well as /r/USMC, and it seems that most of the Marine Corps has adopted the roving watch idea.  
I can't say for sure that it's my fault, but it certainly seems that way!In fifth grade, we had to make three sentences of at least 7 words each, using at least one of our spelling words as part of our spelling assignments. An example of mine would be as follows:

* My hardest word this week is sergeant.

* My second hardest word this week is lieutenant.

* My third hardest word this week is soldier.

After handing back the work one week, my teacher (without mentioning my name) said to all of us, "These three sentences HAVE to show that you know what the words MEAN." I could it really pissed her the fuck off.The after shift free drink from the bar can no longer be the $24 Long Island Ice Tea. Even when the manager says you can have "anything".

And we feel passion to ensure we concentrate our efforts on things that reward us the most.The blocks play corner in my kindergarten got a schedule because my two rather big friends and me (not very big) would block it off for all the other kids.No boogie boarding on the street and no riding a motorcycle on the casino floor. :/ what can I say, I'm awesome, self-five.

I now associate monte cristos with that video, never againA huge, overflowing stew of green, brown, orange, and red chunky diarhea in my elementary school toilet. Complimented with piles of soggy toilet paper strewn haphazardly around. This happened a long time ago, while I was just a whee student. Because of this I dont really know if my memory is completely accurate. Im not sure if that was legitimate poop, or something else entirely. Because shit isnt supposed to be that color. Suprisingly though, it did not smell that bad.Ed Offended. Do not look it upDissecting a cows heart and lungs in middle school, we put a tube into the lungs and inflated them by blowing into it. I remember one girl tried it, and let them deflate with her mout still on the tube. She got a mouth full of assorted fluids and immediately vomited.

EWWWWW! The things we did for money.After birth, someone on here mentioned it and I being the idiot I am looked it up. It's disgustingI used to know a guy in high school who would lick the sauce cups clean during lunch. I mean, that alone isn't gross. Licking up your ketchup/bbq/ranch/whatever is a thing we all do when we're alone, right?

It doesn't stop there. He'd shove his tongue in the cup, and there'd always be one of those disgusting saliva strands coated with whatever he was licking up. For some reason, my brain always associated it with his breath, which wasn't the nicest.

I had to stop sitting at that table. It just grossed me out way too much and I was on the verge of vomiting up my lunch. I literally moved to a table where we made gross food combinations and fed them to this one kid, and I didn't feel nearly as sick as I did watching that kid lick up ketchup.My first year of college I was living with a roommate who had no bathroom edicette. Anyway, I got super drunk one night and of course, in typical college fashion, was going to throw up. Being the responsible young adult I was, I quickly made my way to the bathroom and fell on front of the toilet. I lifted the seat and immediately shoved my face above the water only to find out my roommate had clogged the toilet with what was the most foul napalm shit I have ever seen. And I got more than I'm happy about on my face. Then I spent the next 20 minutes throwing up while in the shower trying to wash shit off my face.

Looked like a huge blood clot.Foley catheter being inserted on a 850lb woman who I'm pretty sure hadn't gotten off her bed in months, much less effectively washed her cooch.  The smell was unbearable...Walking to Ikebukoro Station from home in Tokyo: Saw some police surrounding a man on the sidewalk. He was a homeless guy, and probably in the midst of a schizophrenic episode. He was brown with feces, literally covered in his shit; he'd pooped all over the sidewalk and himself and was lying in the poop; when the cops would get too close, he'd pick up some poop and  toss it at the cops, who'd retreat. He was laughing this totally insane laugh the whole time and didn't seem to be bothered by the fact he was lying in his own shit.

I found out last year, at twenty three years old, that my mother was married once before she married my dad. I found this out from my dad, on the morning of what I believed to be her third marriage. 


He and I were sitting in the kitchen having coffee and he asked when was I going over to her house for the wedding. I said she hadn't said a time yet (it was just a small get together with immediate family in the backyard). He chuckles and goes "yeah I guess for the fourth time, you're pretty laid back about it" I kind of looked at him and said "you mean third time?" 


He sort of paused, his face dropped and he got that look - the "oh god nobody ever told you" look. Turns out she was married for about a year to a guy she dated in her early twenties. It didn't pan out, they stayed friends for a short while but eventually just drifted apart. He and his mother actually went to her second wedding (my mom and dad's). It was just a case of there never being a need to discuss it, and everybody assumed somebody else told me.

Needless to say I never heard back from them.  At the time I was in a job I hated, and this pretty much would have been my dream job, so I never have quite gotten over it.About a week ago we had a blood drive at my school.

Girl: hey do you like my friend?

Me: yuck no. She's gross. 

*secretly crushing on her friend*

This has happened dozens of times now. One time I was even "with" the girl. She totally ice queened me the next time I saw her. Guessing her friend told her what I said. I'm not a smart man. I told my wife her ass looked bih in the dress.When I was first introduced to a good friend, I was told he had just won silver at the Olympics for basketball, I said "so its true what they say, white men cant jump." I was then informed he had on his prosthetic leg and it was wheel chair basket ball. I said "Justin's mom is hot." Completely meaning to say a different kids name. Justin looked at me I looked at Justin then to the other kid Koda. "I MEAN KODA'S MOM IS HOT." That almost turned out disastrously because Justin is super protective of his family and one of my closest friends and fuck Koda I hated the kid but his mom was a beauty."I can tell she uses good stuff."

I haven't tried jumping through the air while firing two handguns simultaneously but I seriously doubt it's easier then just shooting one of them standing.Bad guys missing with a gun.Starting an airplane.

Here is a fascinating dissection by Vimeo user Matthias Stork which is seven months old, but recently written up by Indiewire and tweeted by Roger Ebert, so I thought it was worth sharing. It delves into the relationship held between movies and gameswhich goes further than simply having more cutscenes in games (though this, too, is explored). The relationship is actually mutual in some cases: I was impressed to see almost identical-looking footage of Spider Man and Mirror's Edge side by side.

All in all, a hugely informative video that I highly recommend watching. It makes me wonder about something a game designer once said to me: that the movie industry is becoming more and more influential in the game worldand yes, not just because of cutscenes and cinematic games.RussiaMy friend calls her SO 'Worst-Case-Scenario Man as he always worries about, well, worst case scenarios.Any drawing or writing you can pull out and the object would be there but without anything to draw/write with/on then it's useless.

Every time that man stands in line, the person in front of him has a problem where we end up stuck behind this person for 10-20 minutes. At first I thought he was just exaggerating, but Jesus no matter the time or place EVERYTIME. I try to not go places with him just for this reason. 

He started calling it his superpower and how shitty it was and that's why it reminded me of this. Pretty useless I would say. There's no way I can turn it into a positive outcome. The ability to do math, but only in situations where math is unnecessary Bullets are the only thing that can hurt me.I want to grow my hair and suck it back in on command. Unlimited hairstyles.

It's not totally useless as I can't reuse those addresses, close enough.To never miss or wait on transit again. The ability to butter anything by just staring at it.

That's got to be the stupidest thing I've ever written.  It sounded cool in my head, though.Real invisibility.  Think about it...if you're actually invisible, you're completely and perfectly transparent.  Light passes right through you, including your eyes.  So, your eyes can't capture light, meaning...you're completely and totally blind.

Every 100 years an existing star reverts to where it was 100 years ago.

It's Saturday, so I can't be bothered to think of any ramifications due to this, but I'm sure someone smarter than I will tell me.There is no longer an absolute zero for temperature; when everything would normally totally stop moving, it instead moves backwards through time. The colder it gets, the quicker it moves backwards. The the speed of light (or C, to be more accurate) wouldn't be the universal speed limit.I've always wanted a little box with a single knob on it which makes small adjustments to Planck's constant. But probably if I turned it the universe would disintegrate or something.gravity is stronger if distance is greater

But when we are apart, I feel it too

And no matter what I do, I feel the pain

With or without youWhen I was younger I worked at a restaurant with one of those guys that moves from place to place a lot. We got hired around the same time and worked together in the kitchen for four months before he decided to move to Arizona for no reason other than he felt like it. We had gotten somewhat close, but lost touch after he left. 
2 years later while on vacation with my family in Washington State we stopped at a random diner for breakfast. Of all the restaurants in America, and all the sections we could have been seated in, we got seated in his. Arizona didn't work out so he moved up to Seattle for a change in scenery. 

Believe it or not, that wasn't the last time i'd run into him. After graduation my friends and I went on a cross country roadtrip. One night we stopped at a shitty motel in Michigan. The graveyard office shift was being manned by no other than my friend from the restaurant. All of us hung out all night getting drunk and catching up. 
Its been a few years since then so I feel i'm overdue for another chance encounter. Not really freaky, but my girlfriend and I went to Japan last fall. After we got back, we took a small trip to LA (we're from Northern California). On our last day in LA we went to a restaurant, my girlfriend was wearing her t-shirt she bought in Tokyo that had a picture of a map of the Tokyo metro. Our waitress saw her shirt and asked if we got it in Japan. It turned out she was in Tokyo the same time we were, only two metro stops away from where we stayed. Pretty cool coincidence.After my wedding, my husband and I took off on roadtrip. Our goal was to drive up to Maine over the course of a few days, detouring wherever looked interesting and stopping at a bunch of interesting sounding places along the way. We planned nothing, and settled wherever seemed comfortable for the night.

On our third night in, we stopped at a lovely-sounding hotel that my husband picked out. In the lobby, we spotted someone who looked an awful lot like my mother-in-law from the back. She turned. It was my mother-in-law.

Her mother had decided that she wanted to go up to Maine right after we'd left, taking her daughter with her. They had picked the same hotel that we did for the night. 

Thankfully, the rest of the honeymoon did NOT involve accidentally booking into the same hotel as family. Mom and co-worker here in TN were both living in same city in CA in late eighties. They also attended the same Peter Frampton concert here in Tennessee in late seventies. They've never met each other even to this day.A few years ago, we took a trip to Smoky Mountains National Park. We ran into my brother's friends, and a neighbor. **Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

It helped me develop a sense of pride in trying my best even when less effort would have sufficed. The teachers. I'm only in university now so I haven't really lost this concept but I think it's really comforting to always have someone to turn to and someone who is, in most cases, more knowledgable about you by a significant margin and willing to help. I'm pretty scared of losing that.Hug me tight to get my phone My elementary had a live morning news broadcast that played in all the classrooms. Fourth and fifth graders got to volunteer to be on the crew. We learned to work the cameras, chroma key, anchor, and just overall run a T.V. program all on our own.

Wow!Going to college is amazing because you can essentially take classes on whatever you wanted and learn things never taught in junior/high school. I like that college is 11 years in the rearview mirror.The girls, the drugs, no rent or bills. Good, for the most part!  Lots of fun conversations and content.  It's also put me in contact with some of the shittiest people it's ever been my displeasure to interact with, but that hasn't really hurt me personally, it's just a bummer to know that they exist.I'm still here, don't you mean "how is"?I met a lot of people that are experiencing the same things that I'm going through right now. I also am given great advice.  I have great laughs when I am on Reddit as well, which is a plus.

Shaving. It's a requirement of my job to stay clean shaven, and most people are annoyed by doing it. I find it relaxing and enjoy the practice. Waking up early and peering out the window, and seeing that the sky is that beautiful shade of dark and soft blue. It's such a calming feeling. I like to go to my overview, do Ctrl+F, and search "points" (not point) to see what comments of mine are liked and disliked by the community. By doing "points", it ignores anything that nobody has upvoted or downvoted.I love slicing cucumbers. I don't know what makes it so satisfying, but it's probably my favorite part of work. On slow days, when I have more time, I ditch the mandolin slicer and use a knife instead. It's just a perfect moment.

How you can get enjoyment out of hurting your dick is beyond me.Diaper fetishists.

More power to you if you're into that, but it creeps me out and disgusts me if I'm being honest. People act like being into feet is the grossest thing out there, but I'd rather be proudly known as a foot fetishist than a grown man shitting in a diaper pretending to be a baby. There's just this creepy pedo undercurrent to it for me.  Furries.Two individuals which are not equal mentally. Kid, animal whatever. I do not get you want to have sex with someone or something which is not able to say no to you.Vore.

I can get used to a lot, but this just gets a pure "WHAT." from me.Adult baby diaper lovers. Someone wanting to pretend someone is a baby and then fuck them just freaks me out.Cuckholding. Feedism. That's some long term harm your are doing to you/your partner's body. Kennel clubs. Like, they eat dog treats. That's about all I know about them. From what people have explained to me is it's like furries, but more serious and leather.

I honestly dont see the appeal in feetBalloon fetishists. Balloonishists. Ballooneristas. 

At least with other uncommon fetishes, there's a person touching you. Touching in a weird, probably messy way, but there's touching none the less. I just can't imagine how a balloon gets you going. Seems harmless, at least./r/bimbofetish Putting things in your dickholeFeetA lot of these comments can be explained by reading the [Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_of_Unusual_Sex_Practices).

Honestly. How and why the fuck do grown teens and adults get off on sitting in a diaper filled with their own filth...? How is sitting in a shat diaper at all arousing?As a straight male, blowjob.

But add to that...fisting, scat, and shoe worship..I've seen guys kissing and sucking on the woman's high heels...I just don't get it. Surprised no one's said this yet. There's a fetish for people who like having bugs crawl all over them. That is like the event horizon of fetishes I will never get.

Depends on the drink! 

Wine = happy/giggly 
Whiskey/Bourbon = philosophical 
Tequila = angry 
Vodka = sick 
Beer = talkative  Less hungover than the normal mePleasantThe exact same as sober me. It's bullshit Racist as fuck. Doesn't it sound a little racist when someone says that the white race must be kept pure and free of foreign influence.It can definitely be icky-gross in some circumstances, IMO. 

Learning about other cultures, and indeed enjoying some aspects of them, increases common understanding and appreciation.

But you can do that in a way that's cool or in a way that's dickish. 

To me it's no different from (ugh I can't believe I'm even saying this on Reddit) "political correctness". It can be nice to make an effort to not be a dick to other people. It can even be nice to gently try to help someone understand that they are coming across as dickish when they perhaps don't realize how they are presenting themselves to the world.

Obvs, that can be taken too far, and people who try to set up shop as the PC police or the cultural appropriation police can very easily start acting like dicks themselves.99 times out of 100, it's a bad joke.  
  
No one, and no culture, fucking owns a hair style.  No one owns a fucking hat type either, you want to wear a sombrero or a yarmulke I could care less.   You might look dumb but it doesn't make you a racist.   
  
To claim that I'm only allowed to enjoy art, clothing, and music that I can trace back some ancestor to the same ethnic group as is stupid.  
  
  

   
what are your views on cultural appropriation?

is tea appropriation? is [dreadlocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDlQ4H0Kdg8)? what about chinese take away food?The typical way of describing "cultural appropriation" actually describes.... culture.

It's fluid. That's the point.I think cultural appropriation is something that enriches everyone, and people who hate it are racist, painfully ignorant and wildly hypocritical.

I love tacos. I also love stringed instruments. I like space exploration, and I like foreign cars. I culturally appropriate like a motherfucker, with no regrets.The term is problematic because ownership of cultural practices and traditions is difficult or impossible to establishment. They have always been diffusive. 

We can all think of egregious examples of a dominant culture taking something from a subdued culture and making a mockery of it, such as the caricaturing of Native Americans by many professional sports teams. But, would it be reasonable to consider as exploitation the fact  suburban white kids  are some largest consumers of rap and hip-hop, music originally written by and for African-Americans and in a particular social context? I would think not.
Best to avoid, but concerns about it seem overblown. There are far more important problems to worry about.Millennials have too much free time.I dunno everyone seems to blow up about it when it's  Native American headwear or dreads, but come Oktoberfest everyone seems to think it's ok to dress like a slutty pirate and call it a dirndl. It only seems to be an issue for cultures other than those with white skin.

To clarify- I'd never wear blackface, I'd never wear dreads or Native American headwear- I just find it intersting no one cries foul n for Oktoberfest or even St Patricks Day.Imagine if you loved your grandmother very much. One day she made you a sweater. It wasn't the best sweater but you loved it because your grandma who you loved very much made it for you. Then one day she dies but you still have the sweater to remember your love for one another. Years later someone sees your sweater and ask you where you got it. You say it was a gift from you grandma and its very special to you. A weeks later you see that person wearing a similar sweater they had someone make for them. Then they came up two you like "hey I got one look at us were twins" in a very trivial way. Thats what its like to me anywayI have no patience for people who want to tell me what I can eat, how I ought to dress, or what I should be allowed to say.It's nonsense. I honestly could not give two flying pig shits.  

If I want to have dreadlocks, I will and you can't fucking stop me.  
If I want to eat tacos and drink tequila, I fucking will. It's a way people found to keep feeling unique and special. Like: "Hey look how amazing we are with our hairstyles and you won't ever be one of us because we're special and you're not actually you suck"


And it's also bullshit.I always think of that term as somebody trying to be an ethnicity that they are not. For example: Hardcore weeaboos who think they are Japanese.I think people like to pick fights. And it's just another tool they use in picking said fights. It's been going on so long, it's kind of a traditional thing to do. I love Greek Revival architecture, Christmas trees and plaid pleated skirts (similar to kilts.) Does this make me a bad guy because of cultural appropriation? Would "assimilation" be a better word? Ancient advice is "when in Rome, do as the Romans do."White colonialist people shouldn't be allowed to enjoy any products that originated from cultures of color and should instead just check their privilege. 

/sI understand how someone could come to the conclusions some people have but I personally think it's just not an issue. I mean, literally "Well, you can't do that because it belongs to us!"

I can't decide if it's questionable and racist or just straight up immature.[Australian beer ads can be quite good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wM2c3WtDjQ)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDUIIl_OUuo[This](https://youtu.be/cvaRGiMWRaE) This Carlton Draft ad is definitely one of the best: https://youtu.be/GY6uJlI-t14The one at the end of Mad Men.[Jordan vs Jordan Gatorade Ad](https://youtu.be/O6nljThMtEc)The one where they actually show the product's quality and uses without exaggerating the stupidity or laziness of the average person.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6SoqMPhDXQ[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvBCvA1LE8o) counts, right?Skittles! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WASn6PRG1FcThe "PULL THAT PEACH!" ad from this year.The Michael Vick [experience](https://youtu.be/5Oag8iBB7HE).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7sKexJ4Lmw[Magic Fridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67dRRrRz2t8)Pretty sneaky sis

So one day I went to the grocery store and when I came back to my car with my stuff some lady in the parking lot came up to me and asked if I could spare her some money for gas cause she got stranded and needed to get to work before she was late. Me being cynical as I am offered instead to go to the gas station with her and pump some gas into her car, afraid that she might have been lying. So I follow her to the gas station at which point I go inside and ask the cashier to put $10 on pump whatever. I go back to the woman's  car and proceeded to pump the gas for her. I asked what her name was and where she was from, She said her name was Lya and she lived in Anaheim. I told her that I had family that lived in Anaheim and we chatted some more before the gas finished pumping and she was on her way.

So I go back home and put my groceries away and start browsing reddit for a few hours. About 3 hours after I got back from the store I get a call from my aunt Rosa (one of my family members from Anaheim) saying that my cousin Kevin had gotten in a car accident and that he was in critical condition at the hospital. I rushed over to where he was taken and everyone from my immediate family was there at his bedside in the ICU. Next to them to my surprise was that lady from the parking lot from earlier that day. They were thanking her and my aunt Rosa gave her a hug. When I approached them I was kind of at a loss for words and when she noticed it was me she kind of was too. I managed to say "Hi." While being dumbfounded, and then my aunt said, "Jake, this is Lya, she's the EMT who brought Kevin to the hospital. She got to him fast and was able to keep him alive while the firefighters cut through his car to get to him." So many emotions were running through me I couldn't move or say anything. All I could think of was if I hadn't given her the gas money that my cousin probably wouldn't have been alive that night.I bought 10 lotto tickets and won 3 millionProstitute in the Philippines.

Fishing comes to mind first. Nobody cares about their mother or sister?There was this one time I performed an action that led to an undesirable outcome. It's bothered me for a while, and I've even lost sleep over it.My mother had a sudden life threatening medical condition when I was in high school. I was already experimenting with some drugs and binge drinking which I got away with because I was an excellent student and a smooth talker. 

I was the oldest child in an abusive family. My mom was the one who kept us safe from my dad most of the time. I wrote in my journal that if she died during surgery, I would want to kill myself but I wouldn't have the freedom anymore because I would have to find a way to save my siblings. 

I avoided her like the plague while she was sick and did a ton of drugs. I snorted bath salts and cocaine and even stole her medication to get high. I didn't help her at all and she even had to confront me about stealing her money and pills while she was sick. 

It's fucking heartbreaking to think I did this to someone I loved so much during their time of need. I will never be able to make it up for her. It's the only thing in my life I know I will feel eternally guilty about. I try to be a better person than that every day. And I try to be compassionate with myself because of how scared I was. Glad she's still around because I feel like the universe or God or whatever is giving me a second chance to show her how grateful I am for her. Nothing. I guess that makes me a narcissistI wish I didn't ditch my college graduation (I went to the small ceremony and was wiped/was ready to move back home so skipped the big one) because for one I, like a jackass, forgot that my best friend mentioned she would be by herself and two, I would've met her husband for the first time after knowing her for four years. He died a month later. The first time I "met" him was when I went with her to his viewing at the funeral home. He was only 22. Even though there was no way for me to know he was going to suddenly fall ill or that he was even going to her graduation (he was several states away for work with almost no time off), I will always beat myself up about it.

By keeping yourself organized you will start to feel better about yourself by simply being more clean. Being organized minimizes other pressures and influences that will otherwise invoke or aggravate one's stress and frustration. You will also be more attentive to detail, by being more readily able to delineate and analyze things. By organizing yourself you increase efficiency and productiveness. 

Everyone is capable of being organized, but it is not as simple as people think it is. Organization and discipline go hand in hand. In order to be organized one has to adapt them-self to such practices and conditions. It's not something that can be done in a day but is rather maintained over time. In this case I see organization as being a skill.SewingInteresting: Learning the algorithms to solve a rubix cube.

PC all the way.Honestly in my opinion a console tends to feel... smoother I guess? I mean I have a PC but, I don't know, I guess something about laying back, putting a disk in a console, grabbing a controller, and playing a game on the TV is just.. pure.I gotta go console I've always had a console and never thought of making the switch to PC.Games on console are much more easier because f the controls. 

But PC games are cool too. Mobile :^)A potato. Seriously hardcore graphics!If it's a shooter, I would choose PC, because I can aim very well( or atleast I think do).For everything else, I would choose consoles,because I can lie comfortably in my bed.I just wish I could run installed games without inserting the disk...Im PC but I do miss the whole halo/cod experience with 12 yo's telling me that the fucked my mom over the mic then rage quitting when I fucking murk them.

That and I have a group of friend I never get to play with now because they're only on console. 

But overall I'd stick with pc because it can do all of the same things plus like idk stream hulu or something on a second monitor. Console.  Tried PC a few years ago.  It worked well for some games, like Civ V.  Most games that were also on consoles were just not as good.  Only a graphics upgrade, so it didn't do enough for me.  Tried to make it more significantly different than a console by running 3 monitors, but that just led to tweaking settings for an eternity.  So, came back to console for probably 90% of games.  It's just easier, and my couch is more comfy than my office chair.PC is truly the best performance and graphics wise it just comes down to the ease of use of consoles and how most of my friends won't even attempt a build of a good PC and since most of the games I play are more fun to play with friends I end up buying most of my games for console.I have a pretty powerful PC but I prefer playing on console. I just want to get home from uni and kick back on my bed playing whatever. I vastly prefer PC, but I don't really have the space for one or money to build one.Cantonese make extensive use of tones to carry meaning. My wife and her mother will engage in these screaming matches over the phone and my wife will claim she was trying to explain to her mother how to light the stove or something.heard mandarine speaking Chinese tell me that cantonese is just a frowned upon dialectThe tones are just different and aren't something you're used to hearing. French, English, Spanish, etc are derived from the same language so their tones are similar.Like others have said Cantonese has tones. What others haven't mentioned is that a large proportion of the older generation of Cantonese speakers smoke so have lung problems making their voices extremely harsh. And HK is rather polluted which also doesn't help the lungs or people's voices. French don't sound pretty. FRENCH does not sound pretty. it sounds like someone who has a spoonful of peanut butter in their mouth. 

"I speak their language, hold on a second." -eats peanut butter

"Bonjour."Personally I've found that in terms of English versus French, that whilst French edges us a bit in terms of sounding nice, in terms of meaning and eloquence in our day to day speech, I find English superior. For example, I work in France, and when I first tried to translate how *I* would ask my coworkers if they wanted to go to lunch etc., then I would try some long winded 'Would you like to go to lunch?', or 'Shall we go to lunch?', whereas they would just say 'Manger?' (to eat?), 'On y va?' (we go there?) etc.I used to think the Nordic languages sounded odd. But after meeting Norwegians and visiting the country it sounds more like they are singing when they talk. Cultural association. Often, the way we think of a language is the way we think of the people who speak it. Which is why German sounds like a serious language and every Italian word sounds like food to me--because I see Germans as serious and Italians as food-lovers.I can only guess that it's coincidence.

In some languages, somehow soft and voiced consonants like M and R and J became more popular, in others hard unvoiced consonants like S and T and K became more popular. So French sounds flowing and melodic and Polish sounds pretty harsh and hissy with a lot of different sh and ch sounds. Try somali.I like the ones that flow, not the "clicky" ones.I love hearing Cantonese being spoken. I like it more than Mandarin, for sure. But, I live in an area where we have a very large Chinese population, and most ppl's families come from Hong Kong. (Im in British Columbia). Our Chinatown, which is the oldest in Canada, I think, is pretty much all Cantonese: there are people who come to Vic, and never learn English, because they don't have to. They work in Chinatown, live nearby, and all their neighbours and friends speak Cantonese mostly. Anyway, I learned some Cantonese from an ex boyfriend, and its really cool: even the insults sound nicer IMO. Take "Fae Paw" it means "fat old bitch"....but it sounds pretty almost. 


Maybe I just like the weirdness and hilarity directed my way when I conduct an entire transaction in Cantonese, at a shop in Chinatown. Tall, very white girl in a metal shirt and bright magenta hair, it usually causes people to laugh their asses off, and I love making people laugh.For me, languages like Cantonese and Vietnamese sound unpleasant because of all that sing-song, up-down tones they have dancing all over the place.

I have nothing against the people or anything, just that I don't like how the language sounds.

You will die of heat exhaustion in that armor.  Air travel would be a lot less of a pain in the ass like it was beforeThe TSA wouldn't be harassing my brown ass as much.We most likely wouldn't have gone into Iraq. And we wouldn't have disbanded the Ba'ath party. And we wouldn't have left a festering power vacuum there. And that vacuum wouldnt have been filled by former Ba'athists who were pissed that control had been wrenched from them, and formed a group called ISIS to try to take it back.Isis wouldn't exist. Isis was formed because of radical terrorists and non radical individuals incarceration in Guantanamo bay. They plotted their revenge then got released. While we were throwing more masses into Gitmo we inadvertently lead to an upheaval of a dangerous force that if we weren't so biased due to 9-11 we wouldn't have created our current foe.There would've been a Forrest Gump sequel called *Gump and Co.*There might be more snails now. my entire life. im a practicing muslim (muslim clothes and everything)  that was born a couple years before 9/11. i get verbally harassed here and there (i live in a culturally diverse area so not as much as other places), but i definitely get lots and lots of looks. i also cant fulfill all my "american" dreams that i would've liked to. for example, i really want to hitchike/travel america, but i cant due to fear of being killed or severely beaten. im scared of my own country, which sucks.Donald Trump would not be running for president.Racism and fear surrounding muslims and Arabian people wouldn't be so severe. Although I'm sure something else would have happened. We wouldn't have as much knowledge of PTSD or medical trauma, that's for sure. What I personally wish to wonder is how different the world would be if we hadn't attacked Iraq as well as Afghanistan in its wake.Despite what a lot of people think. We'd probably be involved with Iraq right now anyways. A large terrorist attack like 9/11 didn't create groups like Al Qaeda, they were already there under different names. Most likely after Saddam Hussein's natural death, let's say in 2010 of cancer, both his sons Uday and Qusay (sorry spelling) would either kill one in an assassination or if it was failed the country would have descended into civil war. Being the "wards" of Iraq since the Persian Gulf War we'd of course be drawn in. 

If the attack went ahead as planned but failed the likely repercussions would have been cruise missile strikes and special ops raids on Al Qaeda camps. Which would have inflamed more jihadist groups, of course. You still would have armed groups seeking greater power so terrorism wouldn't just magically not exist. Politically you probably would have had a Commission still investigate the events and recommend the integration of intelligence and law enforcement agents into something like Homeland Security. That had been recommended prior to 9/11. Depending on where the failure had been there may or may not have been a TSA. I'd bet on it still existing if the attack went ahead but was foiled. Not so much if it had never been planned at all.

Internationally it would probably be the same. Russia and China would still be adversarial in the muted way they are now. Certain circles around the world would still blame us for all the world's problems. Strongmen would still blame us for their corruption as a political deflection. Getting any country to support any military interventions to stop massacres and genocides would be even harder then it is now. 

**TLDR;** Not much has changed from what we know today. Terrorism exists, Iraq suffers through a war, the TSA may not exist, and the DHS definitely still does.It's almost certain we would have gone to war in Pakistan. Musharraf government was well funded by us after 9/11. Without our guns he def would have been undermined by the Taliban and subsequently risked losing control of his nuclear arsenal.Literally everything We would all be talking about some other date. Remember 6/3! Never forget 4/10! 

The way things were evolving, the shit would have hit the fan sooner or later.The rest of the then-future now-past-and-present wouldn't have happened. You very clearly do not understand the ripple effect.Trump wouldn't have anything to confuse with 7/11They'd still call Freedom Fries "French Fries".

That's why I started kicking asses in the first place.Duke Nukem said that I brought too much gum.Best: Kerbal Space Program



Worst: League of Legendsworst game genre, MOBAs, worst game, League of Legends, best idk.This is completely from my own experience and shouldn't be taken too seriously, but I love the dark souls community. Even people invading your world in order to kill you can show kindness, or do something down right hilarious. 



I'd say the worst is league of legends. I've been trying to get into it for years, but even playing as a level one account against bots people can be downright mean. Seriously, why are you yelling at me, calling me a fucking shit new player, while I am clearly level one and we're fighting bots? What the fuck? I just want to have fun! Honestly, it's a fun game, but I can't focus with all the negativity coming from my teammates. Before the first match is done it's already a job, and not a game due to the negativity.From personal experience I think Hearthstone might have one of the best communities just because everyone is so willing to help each other out. 

The worst to me was probably the MLG Halo 3 community. A bunch of young kids taking the game WAY too seriously and claimed it was the worst Halo ever made yet played it everyday. 

The fighting game community is pretty great irl, but online it is one of the most toxic communities out there.

An amazing show from the opening "Iceman" to the show ending "Shout" about 3.5 hours later. Fleetwood Mac, this year.  *Holy shit*, it was fantastic.  It was the original line-up (Christine McVie back in, woohoo!), I splashed out on good seats and they did not disappoint.  For a bunch of people in their late '60s, Fleetwood Mac still put on a damn good show.  Seeing Lindsey Buckingham do his thing live is a whole other level from the albums or music DVDs.Billy Idol back in '04.  It was a small venue of a few hundred people.  I was a moderate fan of his, but my friend got great seats and needed people to go with him.  After that concert I became a huge fan. He rocked!for more moderate times, French Kiwi Juice is the best performer i have seen.A tie between Rush's R40 tour and AC/DC's Rock or Bust tour but I think R40 wins by a bit just for the fact that they highlighted their entire catalog even down to how the stage looked. DrunkJust another day. We stop celebrating birthdays after 18 in my family.I went up to the Stratosphere in Las VegasHasn't happened yet, I'll come back when it has.Well in about a month I'll let you know.I can't remember it.Meh, normal. Couple friends and a pizza. It's upcoming Lame on the actual day, cause it was a Tuesday.  But that weekend, oh man. Let me tell you, it was mellow and I got drunk with a few buddiesNot quite there yet. Will update post afterwards /sI had gone to the beach the day before and got an awesome sunburn.  I spent my 21st napping on the couch in misery.  When I finally had the energy to go out, my now ex took me to Friday's (his choice) for dinner and I ordered my first drink.  The waiter didn't ask for my ID and the blackberry margarita was disgusting.  Me and me bf at the time were going through a bunch of shit. I had left and went to my parents for a few days. But on my birthday he put everything aside for me to have a good night. Went to see a movie in the city and surprised me with dinner at a nice sushi restaurant. Then some great af sex. Might be boring to some people. But that's been my best bday so far. Fuck I miss him. I hope you see this big head.I blacked out by 8.Got super high with my best friends, watched shitty movies and ate shittier food. I had lunch with my entire family. I'm not really into massive parties when the focus is on me, I love going to parties though. And since the 21st birthday doesn't really have any significance in Australia there wasn't much of a point to a big celebration.
I had two birthday dinners for my 18th, they both had alcohol to celebrate being legal in Australia but nothing crazy.Stuck in an airport. Beer was $8. Not awesome. Took a taxi with an interesting Togolese man to the greyhound station when ot became clear that I wasnt going anywhere for days on a plane. TSA agent at the greyhound station robbed me. People inside the greyhound station tried to sell me crack. Met an interesting poor black woman from Mexico who had a daughter who was an opera singer in Tulsa who she was going to visit. Deaf woman on return bus ride drugged me and stole my cowboy boots. Bad weather again in houston and through whole midwest so I caught a ride to With a buddy going to iowa and drove through the worst weather I have ever driven a car through (not as bad as the hurricanes I've been in but only been on a boat or a bicycle or on foot in them) for pretty much the entirety of the trip after texarkana. Saw probably over 100 accidents while I was awake, but went to sleep because I thought I was going to die and there was nothing I could do about it. Finally got to Desmoin or however you spell that flat useless place and caught an airtran standby to boston. Got to boston in a hawaiian shirt without my bag and had no coat and it was below freezing. All in all, a harrowing but worthwhile experience. The third finest of type 2 fun.I went to class, took an exam, went to other classes, then went to bed. I celebrated a few days later by grabbing a few drinks and stopping by a casino for a few. It was okay, 19 was the best so far, I went crazy. Went to Macaroni Grill for dinner with my family and a few friends. My mom stole the glass that my Bellini came in as she wanted to have a souvenir of the first legal drink I ordered. I don't remember. I know I was sober and alone but I'm not sure what I did.A friend of mine insisted on taking me out for drinks about a week later. It was kind of underwhelming but it was a super nice gesture! I'm not much for birthdays or drinking. I'm throwing myself a birthday party for the first time ever tomorrow (turning 28). Wish me good party luck!Cancer Breitbart.comGreedSJWsYouYoubaseline budgeting

>Baseline budgeting is an accounting method the United States Federal Government uses to develop a budget for future years. Baseline budgeting uses current spending levels as the "baseline" for establishing future funding requirements and assumes future budgets will equal the current budget times the inflation rate times the population growth rate

this is (a) why the federal government has gotten so goddamned big over the last fee decades and (b) why you hear people describe "spending cuts" that are actually increases in government spending ... the "cut" is simply an increase of spending that's less-than-expected. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_%28budgeting%29 Cultural Marxists.Cigarettes. CarniesMinionsThis total apathy for the world we are going to leave the people that come after us. Like we're going to die one day so why think about 100 years in the future, or 500, or 1000. We have so much potential but this short-sighted shit is going to destroy our species.

scapegoats Society.GamblingWall Street.  The KardashiansKanye West.Michigan- 

Summer: Plenty of natural resources and plenty of room outside the big cities.

Winter: White Walkers and wraiths descend from Canada to claim us.  Mass starvation, mass freezing, lots of cold and snow.Alaska. People tend to be better at living off the land here than in most other states, and we are already used to a lack of normal conveniences that the rest of the US shares (especially if we remember pre-amazon prime days), so I think we'd do pretty well adjusting to independence. Our only neighbors are the nicest people so it's unlikely we'd be war stricken. What might cause our downfall would be electing a cat as president.Well my state is part of New England so we might be able to start a UK type alliance to give us an edge over the solo States.Illinois: we'd become the most corrupt country in the world, but we'll survive just fine. Agriculture, globally ranked metropolitan center  water source. We'll be just fine.Have you seen the type of shit that happens in Florida? We'd be goners. Rich states with a lot of people would be fine: Ohio, Arizona, Illinois, Georgia, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, and California. Idaho - we import all our gasoline, so transportation would shut down pretty quick. We would have to trade for gas with other countries. We're pretty solid with other resources like water, food, energy, and lumber. We have a lot of guns so we'd be well-protected. 

If we didn't have to stick together as one country though, I think we'd probably split apart. North Idaho would join up with Washington, East Idaho would join up with Utah, and Southwest Idaho would do its own thing. Maybe we'd invade eastern Oregon just to see if western Oregon notices.Missouri. We'd fail, horribly. Our only resources are the caves, I swear.Minnesota's good. Iron range, shipping via superior, 3m, Cargill, Target, Best Buy... Universal healthcare and paternity leave here I come.Minnesota would be alright because we've got a lot of farms/produce and Canada likes us. Nevada would take all the other state's moneyWell, D.C. would be fucked, even if we revert back to Maryland's control. Probably we'd be more fucked in that scenario while also dooming Maryland.Cali: We have Hollywood and Silicon Valley so we stay fabulous and innovative... while living in the tents due to high rent, next to our cars since the traffic is pathetic, while being severely dehydrated buying Voss water in our ultimate vanity.   New York - Because Wall Street still owns you *no matter where you live*.Maine is practically on its own as is, we would be fine. Hawaii.

Economy and Military.

If the Federal Government pulled out, we wouldn't be able to defend ourselves during times of war.

If the state of Hawaii was a country (like other Pacific Island) nations, our economy would be messed up.Florida doesn't exactly scream success now does it?Living in Indiana would be... *interesting* to say the least.
More than it already is.Ohio has an economy comparable to Iran. We'll be fine.Washington state... ports, air hubs, water, agriculture, some big industries and tech. We'd be fine, but we'd still have a sizable bunch in the East that would want to secede and join Idaho.Realistically, the Northeast megalopolis would amalgamate into one country. **TEXAS**

Most of the people in the service are from Texas, with our guns, horses and proud Texans we are bound to survive. We also have the most amount of pickup trucks and also are closest to Mexico so we have vast amounts of man labor to build our walls around the state and have agriculture to feed us. 

We'd have the NASA Johnson space center to maintain control over the moon, the medical center which is the top of the other nations to maintain our Texans healthy and we have the Gulf of Mexico to produce food for our people. 

Oh did I say we also have our own electrical grid? We don't depend on anyone and we also have solar and wind power as well. 

Did I almost forget Bush? No I didn't, Bush had a banner that said Mission Completed, yeah he completed missions and he will lead us to greatness. 

With the most amount of service men and service women, we will be ready to defend our Texas Country in case any of the neighboring countries try to get in. We will take all our rattle snakes and put them along the wall, in addition we will maintain a steady supply of BBQ for our Texans. 

But who am I kidding, we are already a country, we are Texas. 

**EDIT:** Where are my Texas Boobs??I think New Jersey would probably be okay, as we've got a surprisingly good amount of agriculture and are still bookended by two major cities (including New York). The Jersey Shore would probably become an even bigger priority as the way to pull in tourist money, and we would almost surely need open borders with New York State.Wisconsin, 20th highest GDP so we would do better than most, we're surronded by Great lakes and farmland so food is no issue, and now we can finally achieve our dream of going to war with michigan and anexxing the upper peninsula.West Virginia will be an Alt-Right wonderland, a bible in every hand and a gun in every home.Maine: We got some tough SOB's here. We'd be aight.I think Ohio would do pretty well. Lots of agricultural, a good amount of coal, access to Great Lakes, could get steel mills back up.  And very importantly the Lima Tank plant were the make all the Abrams tanks aswell as Camp Perry which is a marksmanship training base. So None of the surrounding states would be able to invadeWe have a whole bunch of fresh water lakes surrounding us. Plus an upper and lower land mass. And Kid Rock. I feel like a lot of states would try and get us as allies. Not because we have anything great to offer, but because we have a lot in common with a lot of bordering states.

Oklahoma.Ohio's a decent state for a country to take off from. Wet land for crops, Lake Erie for "Drinkable" water, a handful of theme parks for tourism, and we haven't had any noticeable corruption going on. We're just kinda the "meh" state of the east coast.North Carolina: fail, HB2Colorado: we have one of the fastest growing economies because of industries like aerospace, green technology and internet companies. Lots of people moving here. Tons of natural resources from gas to crops, even water as many of the great plains states rivers start here. We have an even political mix. Year round tourism in the mountains. We're the first and healthiest state. We contribute more to federal taxes than we take. An ever improving social situation as pot legalization had led to less crime while the money is spent on education, drug abuse education and helping the homeless. We'd be on of the safest if attacked because of much of the lay of the land as well as a large military presence as the Air Force Academy is located here (that may change in this situation, but assuming that the people there would remain).Vermont is only one of a couple States that had previously been their own country. 

I think we'd be fine. We have maple syrup and gunsI think Oregon would be fine. Probably have a horrible immigration problem though.North Dakota here. We have plenty of acreage, most of the wheat, lots of beef, all the nukes, and a surplus of oil and lignite.Not American, but I imagine Alaska would be fucked when Russia decides to Crimea them.Kansas. We've got your soy and wheat. Good luck without bread and tofu bitches.You'd be surprised how truly racist some states would become without the federal government preventing them. Segregation would be back in more than one state in the south.Indiana:   Knowing Indiana's history, I can only imagine plenty of people wearing white robes and burning crosses in their front yard while eating plenty of corn.  So, fail.  At least I won't starve.  Michigan. We would hold our own. Probably sign a treaty with Canada.Succeed:

- We can trade with Canada, Oregon, and Japan easily

- We have a lot of natural resources

- Pretty Mild: Weather isn't terrible, no venomous animals

Fail:

- We would instantly lose the Eastern side of WA to Idaho, the Eastern side has most of the agriculture.We would be more than 50 countries. There are parts of states in this country that want to succeed from other parts of their state. I'm fairly certain that in my state this could lead to another civil war.Arizona: It would probably be legal to carry every time of weapon anywhere. Our education system would probably become worse since it's already ranked 49 in the country. 

It would probably fail pretty hardThey stopped updating [these billboards]( https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fi537.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fff332%2Fsunhawk61%2FKansasFarmerFeeds.jpg&imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smoked-meat.com%2Fforum%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D454&docid=C7ierEd4QjmRVM&tbnid=ApqXctyZB0pPOM%3A&w=640&h=480&client=ms-android-verizon&bih=559&biw=360&ved=0ahUKEwjUnfbdq9nMAhXHQiYKHcJIBeIQMwghKAUwBQ&iact=mrc&uact=8) in 1999, but they've always made me think Kansas would be okay in this scenario.New Jersey would be okay bc y'all need us for pharmaceuticals. Though, we might split into three separate countries ourselves so you never know.Virginia - All major military bases and weapons companies are here.

Cons - All major military bases and weapons companies are here.New Mexico would perish pretty fast. We're poor as fuck and there's no real industry here - not to mention no water. I imagine we'd just get reclaimed by Old Mexico.

That was pretty depressing to think about.California has an economy larger than most countries, and it grows a huge percentage of the country's food. We also control some major ports. We'd have to work out some water rights, but it seems like we'd have a lot to barter with. Cali: We already have a massive economy so we'd go straight Six-Day War on Washington and Oregon to annex them for their water. Idaho: Lots of good farmland, lots of wild game, lots of livestock and people that understand animal husbandry, lots and lots and lots of guns and a gigantic nuclear research facility. Also some big rivers and a lot of water in general. But the guns. Def the guns. Florida

Succeeds: Basically controls the Gulf of Mexico, citrus, tourism, and aerospace industry. Huge oil reserves off the coast if we get desperate.

Fails: It's Florida.Illinois would be the Greece of the United States.  We're the worst off regarding corruption and pension obligations. Montana would be fine. High gun ownership, a strong resource-based economy, and nukes make a nice combo.Washington: We have lumber, natural gas, lots of clean energy, great agriculture, two ports and lots of clean water. We are resource rich with ports and a border with Canada with lots of trade opportunities. We have a highly educated high tech work force with a bright economic future. We give more in Federal tax $ than we spend, so maybe it would be an economic relief to not feed the federal government. And we have legal pot. Our exports include airplanes, biotech, software, agriculture and lumber, marijuana and micro beers. The folks in the panhandle would survive.  South Florida would explode into chaos.Arkansas could easily see sustain with all the natural resources and farming and livestock, notnto.mention all the business lie Walmart, Tyson, JB hunt would help make money for the state if every other was an independent country.Colorado would have a balling tourism JUST for the mountains. 

^^AndMaybeBoulderToo.I think Washington would do reasonably well. It has a high-tech industry, massive farmlands, loads of hydropower, wineries, deep-water ports and river access to the interior, a tourism sector, and several  international businesses in residence. We would succeed.  We have it all.  We have tons of industry and one of the largest ports on the East Coast of the U.S.  We have tons of farmland and we even have beautiful vacation spots whether you like the beach or camping in the mountains/forest.  We're diverse, have some of the wealthiest counties in the country and we can easily cross the border into NY to have all the amenities of a big city.  Yep, it's all good here in NJ.Once we walled off Detroit and turned it in to a lawless no mans land the rest of the state would do just fine.South Dakota would  succeed very well for many reasons. In most places here people are so friendly they literally wave to you for just driving by (never happens anywhere else I've been to). While we do have people that don't like gay people most have enough respect not to say anything bad directly to them. Most everyone in small towns know each other and everyone looks out for each other here. We have a massive farming and ranching population that can supply food to everyone here and still have enough left over for exports. The. Let of living is so low that you can actually survive working 40 hours a week on minimum wage in most places. And best of all, small family owned businesses here actually do well here. I have never been to another state with as many mom and pop shops as there are here.Many of these answers seem to think that countries don't trade with one another.Indiana, our motto is "The Crossroads of America".  So we'd just survive on tolls for the trains and semis that go through us to the rest of the states.

We also have corn, and coal I think.  We're one of the shitty districts in Hunger Games.Please, New Jersey would set upon an alliance with the other mid-Atlantic states in a heartbeat - probably. Pennsylvania.  The Amish will guide us. California is probably fucked. NorCal and SoCal would go to war over who gets Central before splitting, and we'd all die of dehydration.... I guess our tourism would be ok though. Walmart bitchesMassachusetts.  Small population with a lack of diversity.  We'd survive on our sports teams alone.Texas. We have our own power grid, one of the largest ports in the USA, we refine a lot of the oil. We also have some of the best hospitals in the world, and a whole lot of cheap land (and guns) lots of guns. Also cows, we have cows. And fish. And corn. And tacos. Fuck yeah tacos. 

Seriously I think Texas would probably handle becoming its own country better than just about any other state. 

Also businesses we have a lot of them. And NASA. And good luck doing your geometry homework without Texas Instruments. Federal taxes would stay in state instead of going to all the red state welfare Queens.[deleted]I live in New York now:  We'd be fine.  Access to the ocean, gigantic metropolis, lots of farmland with a fair climate, good universities, solid infrastructure.  There's a lot to complain about, by NYS is generally a great place.  I'm also not positive, but I think we pay more as a state to the federal government than we get back in benefits, so we might even get a tax rebate.

But I'm from New Jersey--not sure if NJ would succeed as well.  Lots of cities, lots of industry & infrastructure, a fair amount of farmland.  But I think if we were to break up into countries, a lot of North Jersey would emigrate to New York & some of South Jersey would emigrate to Philadelphia.  New Jersey is kind of between metropolises.Arizonan here: The state would thrive, probably expand. I bet Arizonans have more weapons per capita than any other state not named Utah. None of the weapons are registered so it's very difficult to say for sure. People with the plague.Commission based jobs. A group of 5 or more people wearing the same shirt.

What a lovely gestureMy neighbor helped me shovel and wheel barrow two yards of river rock into my pond today. He's a good dude.I had a neighbour who never spoke to me, and only acknowledged my presence with a curt nod while we were both on our back decks having a smoke

This would normally have been enough to make him my favourite neighbour ever, but what he did the one morning put him into the neighbour hall of fame.

I stepped outside for a smoke one winter morning and saw him out for his morning smoke.  He wasn't facing me, so no curt nod this time.  I step forward to grab my ash tray and step on some ice.  I wind up flat on my back with my legs splayed out over my head.  I must have looked like a complete idiot.

All I hear from my neighbour is a quiet gasp, a step forward.... And then, as he sees me rising to my feet, unharmed, a quiet "click" of his patio door sliding shut.

I look up, and he's gone indoors.  He's given me the gift of pretending that no one saw.

Probably not as grandiose a gesture as other stories here, but man, that guy was a class act.I was moving into my new place in July and it got up to high 80's outside. I didn't have water and there was no AC in the house. But my neighbor offered some cold drinks, which really helped!They gave me a kitten. A tiny feisty little girl. Then they gave me a brother for my tiny tiger when their cat had a second litter.

Then she let us stay until they got the house dried out and deemed it safe to go back into.  We were able to return the favor several years later when she had a pipe burst and her house flooded.  She moved last year and we will miss her dearly.  We couldn't have asked for a better neighbor.Always left, tie, then right, tie  I keep them tied permanently and just kinda shove my feet in there. 

Most of the time I just wear flats though. I only use laced shoes for exercising. What sort of monster puts one on and ties the laces then repeats with the other?I have mine knotted so they are snug, but I can still slip them on.Tying shoes is too much work. I have better things to doI generally put a shoe on, tie it, and then do the other.  It's not a set-in-stone rule, though.  If I'm at the gym, I dislike having my feet on the gym floor any longer than necessary, so I will usually put my pants and socks and both shoes on before tying anything.Also of note are the fun, fashion and science of shoelaces http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/index.htmI keep my shoes tied and slip them on and off. I haven't tied them in over two years. They miraculously stay tight. I have them double knotted. I have the help slip them on my feet, provided they have properly polished the shoes, of course.I have no idea! I can't even remember how I did it this morning!Tested it out to see what I do.

I cross my right leg on top to put my right shoe on first.

I then tie my shoe. I hold the loop in my right hand while my left hand wraps it and lips under.  I think that's a bit unusual, since I am otherwise right-handed.

I then un-cross my legs, and bend over to put my left shoe on.  My foot remains on the floor; I can't cross my left leg over my right.  Weird.

We were with family and friends all day and couldn't get away with sexier touching.I wrote a romcom...I touch people everyday...all day...Boyfriend. Oral. A lady friend, last night.

We were with family and friends all day and couldn't get away with sexier touching.There are a couple places in the kitchen that are just plain in the way. Pinch points that whoever is cooking (me) needs to get by to get to the pantry or to the table. She stands in them constantly. I want to paint "don't block the box" on the floor. Leaves the cupboards open. I walk away for 5 minutes and come back to a kitchen that looks like a scene out of paranormal activity.Tells me how to drive. Constantly. It's a real bone of contention with us.1.  Constantly spraying the strongest scented soaps and perfumes.  It gets overwhelming and she never thinks it's an issue.                                          She cooks and I do the dishes, fair's fair right?  But when I've gotten home from work/school and find plates still sitting on the tray with crusted cheese on it and pans that haven't even been soaked I want to choke a bitch.We got in a real good "not talking to you for the rest of the night" argument the other day.  The reason?  I had my sandwich on a paper plate that was actually 2 sandwiched together.  I did it on purpose as I've done my whole life because flimsy plates suck ass. she began chastising me over wasting plates...I being mature, told her I would go buy more the next day and throw them all away right in front of her if she wanted.  Turns out that wasn't the olive branch I should have offered.  

I try to remain rational but she just has a way about her.  

Oh ya, and for bonus she licked her thumb and started cleaning something off of my face in public.  I responded by licking my whole palm and smearing it down her cheek.  Luckily that time she thought it was funny.  Leaves the toothpaste cap off.My wife doesn't ever close closet doors all the way it drives me insane.

She loves it when the house is lit up like we invited the Sun over for dinner.

At that point I'm like 25% omnipotent since I control one of the four dimensions. And it's probably the coolest of the 4 anyway. Much cooler than being master of width. The ability to freeze time. I could do anything that most superpowers would do, but nobody would know it was me.

Flight/Speed/Teleportation: I can just walk to wherever I need to go.

Just look at the trailer from 2002 (Before all of the hard drives were stolen):

The animation in the trailer looks so much better compared to the final film. It could have been a decent film.Ender's Game. Still one of my favorite books but that movie was just wretched.Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Great book. Solid cast. Terrible movie.Native Americans!Pretty much any indigenous peoples.

Every so often Ill rewatch the classic seasons of the Simpsons. one thing I've always thought the Simpson did extraordinarily well was have such a broad range of juvenile to mature humor with a broad range of references to draw from such as films, history and even advanced mathematics to cater to just about every demographic, young and old. Batman: The Animated Series or Cowboy BebopStar vs. The Forces of Evil.

It got a little weird, because the main character was from another dimension, but overall, it was a good time.Gravity fallsAvatar: The Last Airbender, followed by American Dad.Archer.  Endlessly rewatchable. Daria. If any of you are too young to remember it, check it out. It's about an insanely intelligent and cynical teenage girl trying to deal with high school social bullshit and a world full of idiots. 

The show originally had a cool soundtrack from various 90s bands, but when it was rereleased on the internet it was too expensive to pay all of the copyright fees, so they substituted some generic tunes in that genre. But you can google a list of the songs from the original show. Gargoyles.   Cast of thousands, plot where every tiny detail is accounted for, and enough allusions to write a college-level term paper about.  And it was in English to begin with so no chance of a bad dub wrecking it.

Yet, they showed it at 4:30 PM on weekdays as afterschool entertainment.I really love Bob's Burgers at the moment. King of the Hill

[So are you Chinese or Japanese?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d_CaZ4EAexQ) Boondocks Sailor Moon..  Haha 

. Rurouni KenshinVenture Bros.   I loved that show as an adult.  As a child I loved the Simpsons.    Steins;GateBatman, it's literally **The** animated series Frisky DingoDaria Gravity falls and regular show Gravity falls and regular show Kids series: Hey Arnold. The show dealt with some pretty serious/real life stuff but they did it in a way that kids could understand it and relate to it, or that they would remember it and then use what they saw in the cartoon in real life.

Adult Series: Bob's Burgers. The way it's written is awesome. For me I love the constant quick jokes and whatnot that they throw in each episode. Sometimes I watch certain websites twice and I catch new stuff. Venture BrothersCory in the house God, The Devil, and Bob.

I was the senior three letter agency representative for all of northern Iraq and that was alright but I actually can't even legally describe my most significant thing in an open environment and that most makes me proud but that also kinda makes it annoying with women.

On a global level? I gave $5 to make sure we killed the animals, so I guess I'm making a difference in the world?Join the army, then 6 years later left the army. Mine is saving two lives:

I once hold up a friend as he wanted to cross the street as he clearly didn't look and was almost hit by a car, and the other was that I talked an acquaintance of mine out of suicide. Nevertheless, I feel stupid because that were two instances, years apart and not at all connected or significant for my own life. I'm not sure they remember.Probably started playing starcraft brood war in 8th grade. It was the gateway into computer gaming and understanding, which influenced me to go into networking in college as well as becoming a part of Internet cultureI've delivered babies as a Midwife.I saved someone's life after I walked in on their attempted suicide. I stumbled upon them totally by accident.

Other than that though, I have not actually accomplished much.It's basically nothing compared to what other's have said in this thread, but I'm pretty proud of it nonetheless.

There was this girl at my school who was in Algebra II as a high school senior. For a senior, that's a pretty low math level. She had failed the class multiple times, and was failing again. She just didn't understand math. Anyway, her teacher was my former Algebra II teacher, who I had about 3 years prior. I did very well in that class despite my poor attendance and never doing the homework. I guess math (at that level) came very naturally to me. My teacher would always tell me to help others with their work during in-class activities, and I obliged because I didn't really have anything better to do. Anyway, that Algebra II teacher hunted me down in one of my classes and told me about this girl. She said she didn't know what to do and she's tried everything. She told me she couldn't give much more one-on-one attention to this student and asked me to tutor her. I was hesitant, but hey it was my senior year so I wasn't super busy and I could use the volunteer hours.

So I met the girl and we started working through things and she literally did not know anything. Like basic math with negative numbers she didn't know how to do. She didn't know how to graph things. She knew nothing. She took her previous math courses at her old high school, where they just passed her even though she had no knowledge of the subject material at all. So instead of helping her with her current material, I went all the way back and taught her basic math. Every single day I would meet her during lunches and sometimes after school to go over things with her. Once she learnt the basics, I actually found her quite smart and she was able to learn the Algebra II concepts. Things ended up picking up for her and passed the class. She was able to graduate and head to community college as well (first in her family!). My teacher asked me to come to her office towards the end of the year and she started tearing up telling me how much of a difference I made in this girl's life. It didn't even feel like work to me. The girl even called me when she started community college and told me there was no way she would have graduated high school without my help. I completely forgot about using the tutoring hours as volunteer work for National Honor Society or for college apps. I just sort of felt so invested in this girl's education and I felt bad that someone with so much potential was not given the attention she needed to succeed. 

I'm not that great of a person honestly. I try to do good things, but I don't get that "feel good" feeling from doing them. But this was something that I felt really good about. And I didn't even realize how much of a difference I was making at the time. I was just helping her out because it felt like the natural thing to do.What's your definition of "significant"? Helping the most people? Then I have no idea. I don't help people.I worked on a huge budget film this one time, and tomorrow I have an interview that could send me to Los Angeles (from the UK) to do a university.

When I was a non-adult teen, I and most of my friends had jobs.You mean when did it become uncommon for children to work? Like the 1920sChildren have always worked. There were laws introduced in the 1800's preventing them being employed by factories etc under the age of 8 but they were still used. There are current laws in the UK restricting the number of working hours for under 13 year olds  but they still can and do work. In recent years I have been aware of fewer schoolkids working part time but college or uni students still appear work like they did when I was a teen.Some day will be uncommon for everyone to have a job,Robots will do everything for us. In this century? When the economy went to shit.Child labor has actually declined since the early twentieth century.I started working at the age of 12. It wasn't until much later that I learned it wasn't normal. I ask, because this is basis of one of the anti-minimum wage arguments I see all the time: kids trying to make an extra buck after school shouldn't necessarily be getting a living wage. Not that I agree, but I feel like that thought is predicated on the time when after school jobs were babysitting, mowing lawns, a paper route, shoveling walks,.. maybe bagging groceries. When did it suddenly become commonplace for teenagers main focus not to be education and sports and recreation and meeting peers, but instead going out and bringing in the bacon? Or have priorities always been that screwed up?My girlfriend has an identical twin sister, and it's only recently become a problem. The sister has always been as into me as the girlfriend, because they're identical, like beyond genetically. They've always been together, always copied each other to a T. Hell, two weeks ago, I was hanging out with my gf, playing some Super Smash Brothers, when out of nowhere, her sister walks in and said "On a question like this, you should probably put a [SERIOUS] tag unless you want joke answers."The trick is to do it before your brain can realize what you're doing and pull up out of your noise dive of confidence!Words, use words.

Then I told her my cat sent it, not me.I told her over dinner that I really enjoy our time together, and that I'd like to take things to the next step.   
She told me she had no romantic interests - in me or anyone else. 

We still spend time together, and that's no longer an issue.  I care for her deeply, and I still enjoy our time together.    I'll find someone else to try romance with.

I joined the army with the sole intention of giving it my all and changing every negative aspect about myself i disliked. I went from being a 300 pounds, shy, and extremely introverted to myself today. I'm happy to say im close to marrying the love of my life, taking college courses part time and always charming the socks of everyone i meet. Life aint so bad when you got somebody to love who motivates you every single day.I dealt with it and then nailed the dick in the face when I realized the school wasn't gonna help. Worked wonders. Dealt with shit from classmates for years, always minor bs then reacted twice in a year to stand my ground.. Smashed ones head into a window 6th grade in a fight and "beat someone up"... two day in school suspension, if my kids go through it I wouldn't care, but technology records everything... Fast forward, both work for same company and I make more. When he counter offered he asked advice, shit happens when you are young, with peer pressure. I'd encourage my kids to stand their ground and not worry, I went through it so I don't care if they get a day suspension.

Edit... Family favorite story, sorry John (not sorry). Once had a (hockey) classmate shove my papers on the ground with a sub teacher during 11th grade chemistry, (broke wrist in hockey), smacked him with my cast across his head and I received two days off and principal threatened to call police.  Parents knew he was a dick he fucking deserved it.Anything that was done to me I made worse, robbing the glory from the bully and turning everything into a joke for myself.  Before long it wasn't even really bullying anymore, it became a game to us, how far was I willing to go, how much more fucked up would what I said about myself be be, how much more physical would I be to myself, etc.  if someone was being a bully to me, I was suddenly Steve-O.  In our Christian school nobody had ever seen anything like this and by the time I reached my freshman year there was no bully/bullied dynamic in my class anymore, I played World of Warcraft for 2 years in lieu of friends. But I moved to a different school district and people liked me their and I made some amazing friends that I still have.

Vanilla is from the same word as vagina, i.e. "sheath"."Helmet" and "Hell" are derived from the same Proto-Indo-European term with an original meaning of "to hide/conceal". The word "conceal" is also from the same root word.Ankle, angle, angler, Anglo (as in Anglo-Saxon) ... All from the pie word for "a sharp bend"Yellow, Glisten, Glower, Golden, Glower, Glamorous, and other "gl-" words come from the same PIE root and all connote something that shines. Also a lot of "st" words share a PIE root connoting lack of movement. E.g., still, stop, stall, stand, sit, stuff, etc.My favorite is the word "pajama." Comes from the Persian-Farsi compound *paa-jame* that means roughly "leg clothes." Then when the French were working with the Persians, they discovered the word and adopted it and pronounced pajama (with the french j). The Persians enjoyed French culture and began adopting a few words and somewhere along the line, the Persians starting mispronouncing their own word and began saying it the French way and it's even spelled with the same phonetic letter (using the re-je instead of hey-jeemee.)For others ...

Think about the most awkward person you've ever met.  How often do you think of them?  Chances are, almost never, because you're so busy with your own life.  So why do we assume we're the object of everyone's attention and worry?  Would it be so easy that I were an accumulation of just my experiences and nothing incorporeal? None of us are getting out of this alive anyway, so you might as well enjoy every minute of everyday doing whatever makes you happy. It is easier said than done, but it is true.Jurassic Park - there are some really good effects you don't recognize as CGIMad Max: Fury Road.  For the longest time, I thought "oh yeah I know what CGI is, I see the awful stuff all the time".   Then I watched the special effects for Mad Max and had NO CLUE how much was added by CGI versus live stunts.  It made me think back to other movies where I began to ask myself "am I really sure what I'm watching is real?"The Lego Movie TitanicLife of Pi.

I think Singer might've screwed himself by attempting to make it a direct sequel to Superman II.

It's a blight on Singer's superhero record, the three X-Men movies he directed are among my favorite superhero films of all time, with X2 and DOFP somewhere at least in the top 5.Hunchback of Notre Dame 2. It's like Disney fired a bunch of interns but had enough kindness in their hearts to let them throw this dreck on their resumes.Teen Wolf Too.Speed 2exorcist 2. thankfully the original carried enough gravitas to carry it through to the proper sequal.Terminator 3.

I still love the original 3 but, since watching No1. Have not entertained any of the newer films.[deleted]Jaws 4.My second born. Does not live up to the first.Deus Ex: Invisible WarThis situation with my latest love interest.Austin Powers 3 was awful and totally unfunny.You don't. Whether she likes you or not is her decision.

If you try too hard to impress her, she'll consider you too pushy.Just be fun and yourself.Probably bake her a cake or somethingBe her type.

Look, for the most part, you're not going to meet your wife on a public bus or something like that. The cute girl you catch eyes with will usually just be that. Try striking a casual conversation, people sense the give and will give more themselves if they want to continue talking to you. If they don't, you'll know. Let things happen naturally.

Tell me about the girl in question.Pull her hair and throw sand in her eyes. Works 100% of the time.Go watch Elliot Hulse, he is sometimes an idiot but he has a huge amount of clips regarding this particular subject.Be yourself and the right one will come dont be someone youre not and get the wrong girl know how to take care of yourself too shower everyday and have good hygiene overall...with good hygiene and being yourself, someone will come Feed her. Otherwise she gets really angry. Be the last guy on earth.... It would be pretty hard, if she's currently interested in someone else. It depends on the situation.Being lucky maybeConform. Consume.Talk to her.  Make an effort.  Start there.Give her just enough attention to seem like you're interested in her.  Try not to start every conversation with small talk.  Make sure every time you talk to her it seems purposeful.  Find a way to create an inside joke between you.  Talk to her every other day at the most.  Don't always text her first.  Don't force anything.  It will fall into place if it is meant to be.If you try to get a girl to like you most likely you are selling her a false or exaggerated version of yourself based on what you THINK she likes. This is setting yourself up for failure because you cant know what's gonna get her AND keep her. Why would you want someone to like you for anything other than your actual self anyway? Stockholm syndrome. Every girl I've dated liked me for being myself. Just be yourself but be confident in yourself. Confidence is key. That will attract the girl that's right for you. Ether bunny.You can't make anyone else like you, all you can do is be your best and hope other people see that.Get a hobby, hope she enjoys the same thing. 

Alternatively:
Be attractive, don't be unattractiveAsk her questions about herself... show some interest in her thoughts.Ask her questions about herself and LISTEN.  Ignore her and be an asshole.Follow the short, simple ritual held by Dr Zoidburgs species of course. 

Dress up, make a mound of sand on the beach, stand on it and scream until a female approaches you for sex. ignore her.Send her a dick pic.Chloroform, cloth, ropes, blindfold, handcuffs, and a van.

The rest comes later naturally.Calling out the person who said it's her "decision" to like you or not. That's false. By and large you do not "decide" to like something. Did anyone here DECIDE to like pizza, for example? How about sex? When did we decide we like sex? We just like what we like. You have to give her what she wants on that level. The thing that determines what we like isn't conscious thought, though.When Stockholm syndrome kicks in.If you can't win her over by being yourself then you might as well find someone else.  Pretending to be what you are not only works for a short while and once she sees through the pretense, you could lose more than her heart.  Compliments. The best ones are from guys who "just happens to notice" something small.  This guy just looks at me one day and says " I love the shape of your eyes" and continued with regular conversation. He wasn't flirting with me...he just "happened to notice". I'm not sure why i liked it but I kept wondering why he didn't flirt and now it's me who's initiating the flirty conversations. A bee/wasp thing with an ass that was 4 inches long.I was out in the road watching a thunderstorm.  Suddenly, all my (long) hair stood straight out from my head.  Before I could complete the sentence of "WTF is happening?" lightning struck the ground about 50 feet from where I was.I saw a silhouette of an 18th centry ship in the sky during a lightning storm when i was around 7-8 years old. It was as if the ship hovered behind the clouds with a spot light behind it for a split second. I was with my older brother and told him what i saw, unfortunately he didn't believe me. My girlfriend's dad's wang.  They were nudists. Come to pick her up and her dad, fully nude,  answers the door. Relationship didn't last long but always stuck with me. One time I was sitting with my cousin at the dining room table and I saw their cat run past. The problem was, the cat had died the week before. I asked my cousin if he saw it but he looked at me like I was crazy. This was over 10 years ago but I still remember that red/orange blur going past the table.Bill Murray.*saw a squirrel swim across a pool. Doggy paddle. 


*I once popped a blackhead and a 1-inch long pus string came out of my pore. 

Sometimes I also question if what I saw was real. I saw the lochness monster. I really did dude, and i saw it eat donald trumpCaptain Levi from Attack on Titan. He just breaks my immersion so badly. In the first arc Mikasa is the badass fighter but it's obvious that ultimately Eren is the one that has to save them, because if he can learn to control the monster inside himself then there is no greater force on Earth than him.

And then Captain Levi shows up and that dynamic is shattered. He's a "regular human" but he's so fast, skilled and downright physics defying that 1v1 he can win fights that Eren loses. And most fans fucking love him because he's got this tragic backstory and it looks really flashy and cool when he fights. That character almost single handedly made me stop watching the series.Frank Underwood. He's an evil manipulative politician.Harry Potter. I am a massive fan of the series but Harry himself is such a generic, archetypal character. Ned Stark. The guy has no brains, whatsoever. He lives stubbornly by his code, which is fine. But then has the brilliant idea to tell Cersei that he knows information that has gotten someone killed before. By Cersei.

"Hey Cersei, I know something."

"What?"

"Take a guess. Hint: you killed Jon Arryn over it."

Why the fuck would you expect to live after telling her that you know that information? And why the fuck would you tell her in the first place?Micheal Scott from The Office, because he's the fucking WORST.joey tribbiani; he's just a stupid, unfunny douche. I used to work at a department store, and right after getting chewed out for coming into work high, I walk into the warehouse/dock and my boss and the promotions manager are putting together these cardboard advertising promotion displays.

They totally were clueless and I just non nonchalantly go and fix a few of them and they were just amazed...

"Umm... How did you do that?" 

Fucking retards got shown up by a sleep deprived stoner. Final examsI didn't drive.I actually learned a bit of german I followed a recipe and made a curry.Drank waterWhile high on the cocktail the hospital gave me I decided to only give birth at home from that moment on. Two births and a current pregnancy later and I'm sticking to it.Stayed High.try to eat my elbowAnother trick question.To never sleep again Not get marriedGraduated high schoolI hacked my friend's PS3 while high on Ketamine.Realized that I needed help and got someone to come get meAnything and cheesePopcorn + Marshmallows = GodInstant Ramen and waterCorn + butterMelty peanut butter and chocolate.Stale bread and a glass of water.Raw bacon + plate = plate of cooked bacon.  :DCat + dogParalyzed head to toe.My friend once told me this story about a crack addict he knew. So, she goes to her dealer's house. She has no money. She needs a fix and she's begging him to help her out. She tells him she'll do whatever he wants, literally anything. He kind of shrugs and he tells her he's not interested in her. But he owned a pit-bull. So he tells her he'll give her crack if she sucks this pit-bull's dick and swallows its cum. And she does it. He gives her $40 worth of crack in return.

The lesson being that no matter how bad your life gets, you will never be sucking-a-pitbull's-dick-for-40-dollars-worth-of-crack bad.

So, to answer your question, that's probably the worst way to liveIn a job that you absolutely hate, with no drive to get out.  Hating your life Monday through Friday (or whatever your schedule is) and sleeping your free time off just to relieve the stress, waking only to start the same shit again.

Quit that shit.  It's better to be broke and find something you can like/love/tolerate happily rather than spend most of your life in misery.  Without ever taking any risks.Spending your entire life thinking you get some paradise at the end. Paycheque to paycheque. To not.Strip club DJ. AMAIt justifies murder.To eagerly await your children getting older so when they bring their female friends over they can stare at their boobs. Fucking creepy old men. I'm an Uncle, and while it may not be paternal I do get protective of my niece and nephew because of my closeness with them.

I'd say 'hawkish' is a good way to put it for me.  I don't really have a direct fealty to the kids because I'm their uncle and not their mother, but seeing as my sister is a single mother I kind of try and fill the gap of "male role mode" a bit.  

Mostly I just watch them.  I'm always sitting by myself or talking to people, but I take glances over to where they're at at all times.  When my niece tells me she's going to the bathroom I watch her the whole damn way there and then glance at the door until I see her coming back.  

It's weird, but I think it's a good thing.  I'm constantly ready to respond and react when I'm around them.  And I notice myself being more observant of other people around them as well.Forrest Gump. The grave scene when he's talking to jenny about baby forrest being good in school and smart. And I cry because it's a great freaking scene. Up*The Notebook*, whenever Allie finally remembers who Noah is and then so quickly fades away again and the doctors come running in, I can't hold it in any longer. Then when they find the two of them together in the morning, I ducking lose it.End of watch.  

A two best buds who are willing to give their lives to save each other. The Lion King.

"Dad... wake up..."Schindler's List. Especially towards the part where he cries a lot and realizes he could've saved more lives.Eternal Sunshine of the spotless Mind. And, the pursuit of happyness, especially the last part where Will Smith gets the job. Warrior makes me cry every time. 

The end scene where the brothers are just desperately duking it out after both having such heavy situations. And then add in everything you go through with the father.. One of the few movies I've watched multiple times on purpose, even with knowing I'll tear up Finding Nemo and Rudy.

Finding Nemo especially since I became a father and watching Rudy get carried off of the field gets me every time. Awakenings.  Robert De Niro & Robin Williams performances are sublime in that movie.Gran Torino.With HonorsFUCKING BAMBI.

Need I say more? The Bucket List got me, right in the feelsBatman Begins, when Bruce's parents are killed, also the recent Captain America: Civil War when Tony finds out his parents were murdered. Just cuz I know what it feels like.Field of dreams There are maybe 3 movies that I cry to every single time I watch them: Braveheart, P.S, I Love You and Turner and HoochThe Imitation Game but mainly the part where we find out that he was chemically castrated. It was especially sad because apparently that's what happened to him in real life. The opening scene to Star Trek (2012) where Tiberius Kirk is driving the ship into the other ship and his wife is giving birth in the escape pod. Hemsworth does a bang up job in that scene...  Makes my face water every time Marley and me

Old yeller.

I had an amazing golden retriever that had to be put down when I was 9-10. I went to baseball practice thinking she was having puppies, got picked up and my dad told me she was euthanized.  :(Hachi: A dog's tale. 

The whole second half of the movie is a cry fest.The very end of lord of the rings: The return of the king where Frodo leaves middle earthThe movie Southpaw - the scene where the wife dies and he's holding her not knowing what to do, being helpless while she's dying in front of him, that's a pretty deep emotional scene right there The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  
The deaths of both Gandalf (even though I know he returns) and Boromir.
When I was little it was just Gandalf because I thought Boromir was a dick but I've grown so much more sympathetic to him.Up. The beginning montage, and the end when he finds her Adventure Book full of pictures of them together. I've only watched it with another person once, and never will again.Click. It starts with the scene where Adam Sandler's character sees his older-self being a dick to his dad in his office and then realizing he is dead just a bit later. That just tugs the heat strings really hard, won't cry, but it weakens me (and my male friend) for the soon to follow scene where he is escaping the hospital running after his family in the rain and "dies." We flood the room, and usually laugh and make fun of each other for crying as we are bawling. Never thought I would cry watching an Adam Sandler movie in my whole life.Marley and Me, The Pianist and then possibly that rom com Definitely, Maybe.I don't know if it would every single time but I rewatched Bridge to Terabithia having apparently forgotten that it was not a light-hearted story of childhood friendship. Heavy dose of the real world hit suddenly  followed by the tragic aftermath. Definitely got me to tear up and kept waiting for a "it was all a dream" moment that never came.

(Tried to avoid spoilers for anyone who's not seen it. Still a great movie.)Up, E.T., The Color Purple, Toy Story 3, The Lion King. If I don't straight up cry, I'll at least tear up.The scene in Of Mice and Men when George kills Lenny.  

Also cried reading the book.  
Armageddon*Friday Night Lights*

I know what it's like to have an athletic career ended by injury, to lose everything, and to have a very large, enjoyable, and dramatic chapter of my life come to an end. Plus, the nostalgia. 

Sometimes it's too "real" for me to handle.Grave of the Fireflies :(Terminator 2 ;../The Curious Case of Benjamin Button gets me every time.I just cried during "Seeking a friend for the end of the world". So I had to see another, funnier movie right after it so I wouldn't feel like shit for the rest of the day.Sling Blade made me cry like a baby. It was the relationship and the sacrifice, I know its coming every time and every time I cry.Man on Fire.... when Dakota Fanning comes running up to Denzel after being released from her hostage takers and he tells her he's "going back... back to Blue Bayou."  Getting dusty just typing it out and thinking about it.The Intouchables. The last scene paired with awesome music makes me cry every time.

The other movie that makes me cry everytime is "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl". The movie plays with my emotions and I can't stop myself from crying.movies where a dog diesLast Minutes with Odin.*The Grey*.

 
A talking cat when Duffy gets hurt.MaxIn the Two Towers, that impossibly-vertical charge of Eomer's at the end with the soaring music manages it every time.Blood Diamond. The ending is cathartic.Lone survivor, 

The end of the movie gets me every time, all the pictures at the end with them and their family's.The old Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr movie, "An Affair to Remember."  When he finds her at the end and finally realizes she's crippled.    In I Am Legend, when the dog dies Hachiko and marley and me. When your dog dies and these are the only movies your network shows then you sometimes give up being a cold hearted person.Taking Chance, at the end when they show pictures of him from his childhood / adolescence. Gets me every time :')The court jesterThe ContenderTree's LoungeBlood in Blood Out Some Like it Hot.[The Revenant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBN_DbtMl4I) No, not the one with a bear.

The acting is terrible, the plot was pretty good though.Six String SamuraiSugar, by HBO Little KidnappersKilling ZoeRubberI've always been a huge fan of Sex Drive.The Best OfferChildren of a lesser god. Yes it was awarded big the big guys, but most people my age haven't heard of it. And I find it wonderful.Flat earth. I just generally get pissed off when people see something on the news and immediately assume that there was some elaborate plan for this to happen. It's like for fuck sake can anything happen without it being part of some ingenious plot for world domination.

Kennedy dies, all part of a plan. 9/11? You bet. The financial crisis? global warming? some random earthquake? You guessed it, the illuminati did it.We never landed on the moon.  Mostly because it was such an incredible achievement, by so many people, all pulling together.  And some douche comes along with "The flag is waving!" and pisses all over it.That the U.S. government was replaced or taken over by the Navy and we are all subject to admirality laws. They believe that human bodies are boats or vessels and they are enslaved, or something like that. It's a hodgepodge of various conspiracy theories collectively known as the Sovereign Citizen movement. It would almost be funny if it weren't so sad. Sandy hook truthers....worst pieces of shit in the worldChemtrails. People really think that the clouds left behind by commercial aircraft are chemicals being doused on citizens. It's just water vapor folks.Lizard people.That finland is not real,it is really anyoing.Part of me is actually jealous of conspiracy theorists. These people live in a world with no randominity. Everything that happens not only has a reason, but happens through extreme levels of planning and care. Their world is one where a random person isn't capable of terrible atrocities, just hired actors. And, they get to live every day knowing that they know so much more than the average citizen, and could in fact one day be a hero with their knowledge. It must be so much better than knowing that people are both stupid and evil on a very regular occurrence, as some things are out of everybody's control.

To answer your question, anti vaxxers. No theory hurts the world in real ways more than this one. The moon landing was faked. I'm surprised nobody's mentioned Holocaust yet. Considering how many people died I think it's awful that there are people out there who refuse to believe it happened.You're being watched by cameras everywhere you go, even if you're way out in the wilderness where civilization is practically nonexistent.

Just kicked a guy off our property that believed this and a shitload of other far-fetched crap. Was an Alex Jones fanatic and a complete asshole about it.Anytime more than like 3 people are shot, it has to be faked. Staged by actors in order to get your guns. P.S. the next day guns sales sky rocket!Obama is a muslim. He's not. And even if he was, why do you care unless you're a bigot?That 9/11 was done by the government. Oh shut up already.

If you clone a 30 year old star, it will still take 30 years and 9 months until you can replace them with a clone, by then they are 60 years old!Time Cube, it's so stupid and so obviously false that it's ridiculous.A lot of people think Elvis is still alive...really?There isn't any conspiracy theory that annoys me straight up. I keep an open mind and am agnostic about many such theories. What annoys me is when people are completely convinced that a theory is true but don't have any evidence other than crappy second-hand YouTube videos and flawed chains of logic.Rich people are lizards from outer space. For fucks sake people, some can take it seriously enough to stop working hard or chasing their dreams.My aunt believes Obama Care is about inserting tracking devices into people's bodies. I asked her why this would be necessary when we all carry a tracking device in our pocket...Israel and the US are conspiring against Muslims. Like shut the fuck up, the reason you're in shit is because you're lazy, get off your ass and do something productive.

Our government isn't doing a damn thing about something that they knew was an act of war. And further, they are giving aid to the enemy. That would be significant.before it was looked at as Saudi nationals who attacked us, but with no connections to the Saudi government.  Now it appears that there were low level Saudi government employees that gave support to several of the hijackers and support to other people who supported the hijackers.  This is the first time there has been proof of Saudi government involvement [The bill proposed](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/16/politics/saudi-arabia-government-9-11-congress-bill/) would allow for relatives of victims to sue a foreign government (Saudi Arabia) for reparations. Since Saudia Arabia says it will sell off U.S. assets if the bill is passed, it would be harmful for the U.S. to pass.It was an official position statement by Congress as a collective(and by extension the US), compared it previously being personal and semi-official position of various members of Congress and former leaders.

Or "resignation" as a tool of survival. In order to have such a discussion, we must first agree to suspend any belief in the laws of supply and demand. It doesn't matter as long as it doesn't lower. When it raises, the price of everything else raises.$0. The government shouldn't be involved.I don't believe there should be a federal minimum wage.  Economic conditions and the cost of living vary so widely among the different parts of the country that it's impossible to have a single standard that is appropriate for all areas.  Minimum wage is something that should be set at the state or even local level.It should depend on the location. Some places need a higher mininum wage then others $100/hr so we can accelerate the replacement of losers at McDonalds taking your order (and getting it wrong) with ATM style terminals.As a small biz owner  I am comfortable with $15 to $17Probably between $9 - 11 or so. $15 is too high. 

I'd be more in favor of real universal healthcare and making college and skilled trades training more affordable than a "living wage."Im not sure the issue is the level of the minimum wage so much as the broad application of a SINGLE minimum wage.  
Other countries, [Costa Rica for example](http://www.wageindicator.org/main/salary/minimum-wage/costa-rica), have tiered minimum wages that address the skill/training/education gaps between various sectors.   
$10. Should be low enough for rural areas and I think it should suffice to support life with a partner or roommates, not necessarily an independent householdSo I'm an Econ major going into my senior year and I believe the minimum wage should vary upon location. The standard of living of a rural area in Pennsylvania will cost a lot less than let's say downtown LA. The higher the minimum wage the more companies such as McDonalds will turn to automated touch screens in order to save cost. Another point I want to make is that minimum wage jobs are not meant to be full on careers. It's sad to see a mother of two try to support a family by working at McDonald's. It is possible but seems difficult. In theory a minimum wage shows to creat unemployment although that's had not been proven true in the real world. how much it buys

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/04/california-and-new-york-are-getting-a-15-minimum-wage-heres-how-much-that-buys-everywhere-else/We need to determine a specific standard of living that we expect anyone working in America to be able to achieve if working full time. Not a lavish lifestyle or some lofty goal. Just a bare minimum people would need to live, to survive instead of necessarily thrive. We need a formula for arriving at this figure. Every year we recalculate using the same formula and adjust accordingly. It is a waste of time and energy to argue about the minimum wage every 5-10 years. Instead it should constantly be in flux based on the actual goal we want that wage to achieve. Namely, a bare minimum standard for what people should be earning as a result of working. 

I won't pretend to have the knowledge and skills to determine how we arrive at this figure. But at the very least we should take the $7.25 that was set in 2009 and adjust it for inflation every year. $12Either we freeze the prices on basic needs--or make them free--or we keep raising minimum wage.I used to be against what I am going to say here, but I think that the minimum wage should be up to the individual companies.

$13 for national standard, it would probably be liveable and not completely ruin small or rural businesses.


I am not an economist. $8

Because if you don't want to work for that wage, then find a different job and if no one is willing to do a job for $8 the employer will pay more.

Simple case of supply and demand. More importantly, what should the _maximum_ wage be?  There really ought to be some kind of limit.  If a corporation makes a lot of profit it should be forced to pay its employees a reasonable share of that money, instead of giving almost all of it to an elite few at the top of the ladder.floated on the astral plane experience 8/10I was floating outside my skin and looking down at my pathetic shut eyes and felt ashamed to be a mortalWhen I was in labor with my daughter. I floated up and looked down at myself. I recognized that I was afraid and in pain but couldn't feel it. Seconds later I rejoined myself. It was bizarre. Once.  30 years ago.  Group of us are camping, and we thought it would be fun to swing over a gorge at night on a wild grape vine.  We gather around the vine in a circle holding flashlights while my friend Nick hacked at the vine with a pocket knife.  Maybe it was spontaneous hypnosis, but I suddenly realized I couldn't see Nick anymore.  Someone was standing between us.  I could see my friends in a circle with their lights to the center, and I found myself maybe 10 feet behind where I last remembered standing. Then it dawned on me that no one had gotten in front of me - I was looking at my own back.  I was behind myself.  With that realization, I lurched back into my body and stumbled forward into Nick, who was again only 3 feet in front of me.Yes, called LSDa college education.

I mean when I played sports I was a baseball player, I've taken pitches the the fingers, my arm, kidney, shoulder, elbow.  Never any broken bones but that shit hurts and it happened to me a lot. I played kickball around the neighborhood when I was younger was rounding third  which was a flat piece of cinder block on the concrete road, bruised my elbow and tore rotator cuff when I stepped on it and fell that was fun.Not me, but I was playing shortstop one time and there was a pop fly to center. Our center fielder kind of misjudged the ball and had to back pedal after he thought he was under the ball and ended up falling back. He put his arm back to break his fall and then kind of curled up. He weirdly got right up and started screaming and saying "MY ARM! MY ARM!" 

I ran out to help him and he help him, and when he held his arm up, I could see that his forearm had completely snapped and had shifted back up onto the upper part of his arm. If you can imagine it, it was like the shape of a "Z" it was absolutely horrifying and I will never forget that image as long as I live.

I think you're supposed to hate him thoughParks and RecreationStar Trek: The Next Generation. It's Always Sunny. But the thing is, it is worse by comparison, not because of it's quality. It's a fantastic season, but it was before Danny Devito was cast as Frank, so it's missing that flair. Agents of SHIELD. Honestly it started out so slow that I wasn't really surprised that most people gave up after a few episodes. It hit it's stride after Winter Soldier and now it's a pretty great show, but it had such a bad start. Supernatural 

It got me interested but first season was kind of weak compared to the othersThe Office US, it was okay but compared to the rest of the show it was pretty trash.

Rotates your tires. Don't go cheap in tired. For a period of 11 months *both* toilets in my apartment were broken so I would take plastic shopping bags into the shower every morning and shit in those. 

I then put those bags in a large garbage bag until it was overflowing.  Then I would put like six or seven *more* garbage bags over the shit-filled one because the smell was so intense and I had to sneak it down to the dumpster.

I would wait until after midnight to ensure that I wouldn't run into any neighbors and would sneak the enormous shit smelling bag down to the dumpster like I was disposing of a body.  I always had to wait until the night before trash pick up because the smell of rotting shit in a hot dumpster would tip people off within the first day.Moral of the story is watch out for mental health problems in your friends, especially if you or they are in lines of work that are extremely stressful.

My friend committed suicide three days ago. We are both firefighters. He was with a neighboring department to mine. I run the busiest part of the county, and he was in the close second. Both areas are known for drug use and gang activity. We've both run our share of fucked up calls. We knew some things would come back to mess with us. We both thought we could handle it.

About a month ago, his department responded to a quadruple fatality MVC on a stretch of busy state highway that feeds into the interstate. An old van with a mom, dad, and two sons were going about the speed limit (50) when a 17 year old girl decided it would be a good idea to drink and drive. She fell asleep, drifted across the median, and Highway Patrol estimates she hit them head on going over 100. 

The van swerved, but was too late. Her little car virtually sheared the driver side doors off the van. When my buddy showed up the teenager was dead, the dad driving the van was in pieces, the mom was barely alive and both kids were having CPR preformed by a nurse that stopped to help and a Trooper. One kid was declared dead on scene, the other kid and the mom were flown to the local level 2 trauma center. The other kid died on the way there. 

No one saw the signs that seemed so obvious now. Check your buddies and watch their back just like you watch yourself. Mental health issues manifest in more serious ways than drinking a little bit too much. Go see someone that can help. Go see a doctor. Talk to a priest. Do something. Don't let your demons fuck with you. Get help. Was sitting in school hallway with friend. My brother was 20 feet away with his friends.

Hardest I've ever laughed. Look, I'm just a normal guy. Nerd. Im in a game design program in college. I met someone online and we started dating. They came out as trans, and I decided to be supportive, so now we're living together and he's in hair school. Today, his school is having a runway show. He wanted me to model for him. And he wants to dress me in drag in front of hundreds of people. It's not just any drag, it's Vegas show girl. That means I'm going to be wearing basically nothing. When I tried the clothes on, my cock kept falling out of the panties. I have to shave all my body hair in the next few hours. I'm horrible at acting, so I know my posing is gonna be crap. And I'm really, really, depressed after failing a very important college course due to coming in really late to the final test. Been bouncing between /r/college and /r/drag right now. I just want this to be over.I was probably about 5/6 years old when this happened- so my Mum had this cat, Jockey, and we hated eachother. His father was a Scottish Wildcat and his mother a domesticated house cat. He didn't really like anyone other than my mum. 

For either my 5th of 6th birthday, my Auntie and Uncle on my Mum's side bought me a couple of goldfish (I named them Goldie and Fishy because I'm super original like that). I used to feed Goldie and Fishy salt and vinegar crisps (because I didn't like them). 

So one day my Mum is in the bath (it was just her and I, she left my biological father years before) she'd leave the bathroom door open so if anything happened I could shout for her. So on this day, Jockey was sitting beside the fish bowl(one of the old fashioned proper ball bowls), watching the fish and dipping his paw in almost to play with the fish. At this moment, I decided to feed my fish to the cat that I didn't like (for whatever reason, it is unknown to me in my adult life why I chose to do this). So I run through to my room and clad myself in my yellow raincoat, red welly boots and fishing hat, grab my fishing net and run back through to the living room. Proceeding to fish Goldie and Fishy out and feed them to the cat. 

When Mum emerged through the living room door to see me clad in my fishing gear with the cat looking particularly smug and an empty fishbowl I'm not sure what went through her head- but she laughed. 

I've not wanted or owned goldfish since. I participated in my highschool's spirit week my junior year. It was super hero day and I dressed up as Ness from Earthbound/Mother 2 (he saves the world so he's a super hero okay). So it's the end of the day and I'm waiting for my older brother to pick me up. As I'm waiting, a guy walks up to me and asks me why I don't have a bat. I tell him "The Dean classifies it as a weapon so I couldn't bring one." He then says "That's not a weapon *pulls out knife* this is a weapon!" So at that point I'm horrified because I'm like a 5'6 girl and he's a 6'3 weird white kid who pulled a knife on me. He put it away after seeing me sweat bullets :|When I was 25, I was living in a shady, shady neighborhood in Charlotte, NC. I was in a building that had apartments that was in the middle of a neighborhood. My upstairs neighbor dealt coke, and my neighbors in the house across the street dealt weed and meth. (To give you some idea, I started dating a former police officer who lived in another state. I described my 'hood, and he was like, it can't be that bad. When he came there, the police were running through my parking lot chasing someone who just committed an armed robbery. He then said, okay, it's as bad as you said it was.)

Well, I've lived in several less-than-idyllic neighborhoods varying from public housing to the neighborhood I just described. I learned  two things: One, mind your fucking business. Two, mind your fucking business.

As a result of learning these rules, I came and went as I pleased. I would go running in the afternoons through the neighborhood with no problem. (At the time, 25-year-old white girl who weighs about 105 lbs. just trucking through the ghetto.) One day, I noticed a guy. He was just there. Kind of stuck out, because he was a nerdy-looking white dude in a sweater and khakis. No big deal; maybe he's a secret coke fiend.

Well, I start seeing him all the time. Just standing next to my apartment building, staring. I'd say hi, and he would just look. Not leering. Just....staring. There was no bus stop or any stores. He was just standing. And staring. Well, I mind my fucking business and never ask him anything or do anything more than just say hi.

One day, it's pouring down fucking rain. Thunderstorm. Lightning. Fucking buckets out of the sky. I look out my window, and the guy is on the sidewalk just staring into my apartment. In the fucking rain. Soaking wet. Expressionless as always, but not the kind of spacy-schizophrenic stare where he doesn't know what's happening. He's looking and absorbing and not moving. Not a muscle. Never shifted his weight, never wiped the water off of his face, never fucking moved. 

I watch him for about 20 minutes, watching me through the window. We just kept staring at each other. He had this *look* that I can't describe. Like he was trying to figure something out or make a decision....but, with no expression on his face. Just blank.

After about 20 or 30 minutes, I grabbed the only umbrella that I had, and I took it outside and gave it to him. I said, "You look like you need this." He took it from me and said nothing. He didn't open it. He just turned and walked away.

I never saw him again.Last night I did a money shot on a girl idk where to say this but I want to tell peopleI had sex again, twice.TL;DR I'm a piece of shit. 

Ok, when I was 19, we were heading out of town for a weekend ball tournament. It was going to be a blast, and I was pumped. 

Anyway, as we were driving we passed one of those guys pedaling an ice cream/Popsicle type cart. So I demand we pull over, and get everyone in the car something, because Why not. So we all get something and pile back in the car, and I notice a couple of kids (7-10 years old I guess) standing there looking at us. I could've spoken up, got back out and bought them an ice cream too, I had plenty of money for the weekend, but I didn't. I just let us drive away. That shit still haunts me, 20 years later. What an asshole. My Farv ran the olympic torch for the Australian olympics back in the day. When I was in The 3rd grade a teacher caught my best friend (a very clever girl, always topped the class) cheating. Later, the teacher approached me in the quiet and knowing that we were very close, asked me to talk to her if she ever confided in me. But she didn't. And now she'll never know that I know she cheated in school.  For some reason this memory popped into my head./r/just_post

I forgot about this story because Reddit and got the creeps again as soon as I seen your reply. This isn't really a story, but I've always wanted to experience seeing a tornado in real life, or being in an earthquake or a hurricane just for the heck of it. So, I know this is going to get buried, but here it goes.

When I was fifteen or sixteen, My father and I were camping in some nearby mountains. He was going through the divorce with my mom, and wanted some bonding time with me. Summer had just started, and I wasn't working or anything, so I was all for it. 

We hiked 8-9 miles in the middle of nowhere, up next to this beautiful mountain lake. We pitch our tent, go exploring, roast some marshmallows, you know, the kindof stuff you do when camping next to a lake.

We slept peacefully that night. In fact, it was almost to quiet. When you go camping in the woods in that area, you can usually hear crickets at night, or the occasional hoot of an owl or something. That night, there was absolutely nothing. Even the lake water seemed still. 

We didn't notice anything, (My dad and I are both pretty unobservant about things) at least at first. That day we decided to go hiking up even higher, to reach a local peak that was supposed to have great views.  It took us a few hours, and eventually my dad noticed something was off. He paused at one point and said "Listen to that" and I stopped, and realized finally that there was nothing. The wind wasn't blowing, birds weren't singing, even insects couldn't be heard. Something was just....off. 

He isn't a very superstitious person, but I think it kindof scared him. He had been in the military (and he doesn't talk about it, but I think he saw some shit) He decided we should go back to the lake, and book it out of there. 

We ran (five or six miles) to our campsite next to the lake.

Except that the lake was gone. It was completely dried up, as if it was just sucked up by a big straw. And in the center of the lake, we saw a sort of metal box, but it wasn't rusty or anything.

Something drew my father to the box. He just sort of zoned out, and walked down into the dried out lake bed. He opens up the box. I couldn't see what was in the box, but he seemed visibly shocked. I asked him "Dad. whats in there" and looks up at me, with an expression of horror and says "Its the Serious tag OP forgot"**Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

When the 1st party is taught or teaches negative stereotypes of a given race or group of people.  When the 2nd group of people lives up to and embraces the negative stereotypes. Stereotyping based on personal experiences. They either want to validate themselves in some way or they were, at some point, misguided by something or someone. Society, media, their upbringing, unconscious thought, history, peoples tight grip on the past, lots of factors.GrandmaIt's easier than getting to know someone.[Racism as we know it today can, in large part, trace its origins not to the dawn of man as some would have you believe but rather to a systematic social conditioning instituted in response to bacons rebellion. Prior to this indentured white servants where no higher station than afrikaan slaves. Interracial relations were fairly commonplace. After Bacons rebellion the black codes were instituted and white privilege was manufactured with the express purpose of binding poor whites to their fair skinned wealthy ~~masters~~ bosses rather than the other poor people standing along side them in life. Maintaining this separation between the various races of the lower classes is necessary to maintain the demockratic oligarchy. Rebellion requires unity against tyranny. ](http://www.elegantbrain.com/edu4/classes/readings/depository/race/buck_brod_whiteness_jews.pdf)One of the reasons: misconceptions, people tend to think that the majority of a particular race is as portrayed by the media etc.Experience coupled with poor extrapolation. "this type of person did this to me" :. "every person like that must be that way."My theory is that they're lazy. From what I've seen, you only need to talk to someone for a few minutes to find something legitimate about them to hate. But that takes time and effort.

Rather than going through all that each time, lazy people just lump an entire group together.They do this with as many groups as they can, to reduce the number of people they actually have to find a reason to hate.It is human nature to think your own culture is the best/better than othersThere is a natural distrust of anyone different that gets played up and amplified sometimes. 

Other races can become an easy outlet for frustrations/life disappointments. Sometimes people may like just the idea that even if they have a lot of problems at least they are better than (insert minority's here).

Sometimes this is fed into by the media or people in power to appeal to people's natural inclination towards fear. In the Goonies, Sloth should be a pork chop.I'd swap the briefcase in Pulp Fiction for a plate of nachos. I would change those crossbows in the Red Wedding with Nerf guns.

It shows that things are more than what they seem. It is written in a very approachable and interesting way. Most people can find something in it that relates to them. And it's non-fiction.

Also, They Cage The Animals at Night by Jennings Michael Burch.Former HS English and History teacher here. I like a lot of the ideas in this thread: *1984, Romeo and Juliet, The Bible, People's History of the US, and Catcher in the Rye* all have great, relevant things for HS students. But if it came down to *one* book for *all* high school students in the US, I think I would pick a book called *Soul by Soul* by Walter Johnson. 

*Soul by Soul* is a historical monograph, so it would be challenging for many students and a heavy burden for the teacher. However, I think the content would make it interesting for kidsit is a deep, and profoundly disturbing analysis of the slave market in New Orleans and the ideological reasons whites kept slaves. As a teacher, I try to root every novel or historical era we cover in something modern that students can relate to today. It seems to me that the best way to grapple with the racial tensions in the U.S. is by figuring out where they came from. Aldous Huxley's Island The Meritocracy Myth by Stephen J.

I read this in maybe 10th grade, and seeing how the kids dealt with the island and being shipwrecked really got to me.Romeo and Juliet

In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a world of violence and generational conflict in which two young people fall in love and die because of that love. The story is rather extraordinary in that the normal problems faced by young lovers are here so very large. It is not simply that the families of Romeo and Juliet disapprove of the lover's affection for each other; rather, the Montagues and the Capulets are on opposite sides in a blood feud and are trying to kill each other on the streets of Verona. Every time a member of one of the two families dies in the fight, his relatives demand the blood of his killer. Because of the feud, if Romeo is discovered with Juliet by her family, he will be killed. Once Romeo is banished, the only way that Juliet can avoid being married to someone else is to take a potion that apparently kills her, so that she is burried with the bodies of her slain relatives. In this violent, death-filled world, the movement of the story from love at first sight to the union of the lovers in death seems almost inevitable.
What is so striking about this play is that despite its extraordinary setting (one perhaps reflecting Elizabethan attitudes about hot-blooded Italians), it has become the quintessential story of young love. Because most young lovers feel that they have to overcome giant obstacles in order to be together, because they feel that they would rather die than be kept apart, and especially because the language Shakespeare gives his young lovers is so exquisite, allowing them to say to each other just what we would all say to a lover if we only knew how, it is easy to respond to this play as if it were about all young lovers rather than about a particular couple in a very unusual world. (When the play was rewritten in the eighteen century as The History and Fall of Caius Marius, the violent setting became that of a particularly discordant period in classical Rome; when Leonard Berstein rewrote the play as West Side Story, he chose the violent world of New York street gangs.)the bibleDas Kapital Mein Kampf.Mein Kampf.Call mall security. are they causing a disruption?Tell them they have to go.  It's private property, nobody has a right to be there if you don't want them to.  If they won't move, call the police and tell them you have a trespasser.

Alternatively, pay a ratchet friend of yours to piss in a cup and dump it on them.If you're in a state with anti loitering laws, call the cops or security.

If you're in a state without those laws, tell them to leave and call the cops if the refuse. The cops can escort them off the property and issue a trespass order.Murder them and toss the body in a near by dumpster


What you 'should' do is another question.Ask them if they want to leave. Cower and hide if they get madMore information please.Maybe they're shy and want to buy something..There is a specific store out there that allows customers to open-endedly play instruments (mostly guitars).  For the last 3 months, a particular gentleman comes in 2-3 times a day (not an exaggeration) to pretty much hang out for hours on end.  Now, it would be fine if he kept to himself and just played instruments.  Maybe he couldn't afford something yet.  But, he does not.  He stands there... and stares at the employees... waiting for us to engage.

One of our lesser intelligent employees went to lunch with him.  Now he has contact online.  Now he thinks we're his friends.

Now, he's not harmful, let me be clear.  He has hurt no one, seems nice and kinda simple.  HE'S DISTRACTING.  HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE to breathe next to while you're trying to work (my job is repair related so I stand at a desk all day.)

So what do you do when you CAN'T ask them to leave the store, because technically they've done nothing wrong?  There's no clause for extreme loitering.  He's just GODDAMN ANNOYING! Play classical music.  Seriously.  It works.Be overly friendly - offer to be their personal shopper for the day if you really want to be a prick. Let them know that, yes, they are being watched. This is how you can get people to leave without calling security, or the cops. I'm curious to know if anyone tried to get the backstory on this guy.  PTSD from military service, autistic, ignored by parents, ...?

Like a watercolor in the rainLukas Graham - 7 Years Old (the whole song)My parents married young and had me when they were 20 and 22. In elementary school (and further), I was always weirded out by how much older a lot of my friends' parents were. When I was 7, there was another 7 year old that lived across the street.  His parents and my parents would take turns babysitting.  Anytime I ate over there, the mother would sit across from me and just stare.  No expression.  No conversation.  Just stare directly into my eyes for the entire meal.Friend came over and my mom made us a feast of snack food.  I went to dig in and my friend said he couldn't eat any of it.  Being only 7 at the time I took it as a "more for me" situation and never thought anything of it.  Later I learned that at only 7 years old his parents had put him on a strict diet and workout plan because they wanted him to make the NHL.  Seems crazy to me.My friend Clint had a twin sister, they were not allowed in the living room of their own house. It was in the middle of the house. They were a little weird but pretty normal kids. I always thought this rule was strange, their living room wasn't anything special a normal tv, couch, 2 recliners. The also were only allowed to talk on the phone in the kitchen, it was a cordless phone. Not my story but my friends. When she was 10/11 or so, she spent the night with a girl her same age and the girl told her that it was the "night of the fairies" and to drop this liquid into her eye and she would see the fairies. Looking back on it now, she was pretty sure her friend gave her acid or something because she really did hallucinate after the liquid was dropped in her eye. She said the girls family was Wiccan and super hippies. When I had supper with my friend across the street, I thought it was weird that they had soda with supper instead of milk.   
  
But they did have that super-cool aluminum christmas tree.Went to his house, mum and dad, REALLY not getting on, I was raised by a single parent, so I found this novel, if a little intimidating. A month later she murdered him by strangling him with the chord on her hair dryer.I remember one of my friend's had a mother who would lay in her bed and cry really loud with an alcoholic drink in hand. Thought I remembered wrong but my brother confirms it really happened and happened a lot.He seemed to be afraid of his stepfather, and his mother was very strict about cleanliness and noise. She wanted him to stay outside as much as possible. I remember one time when we could actually play inside the house. He had a very neat, orderly bedroom. There was a second room where all of his toys and games were in boxes. He was allowed to get some of them out for us to play with, but his mother did not want us to stay inside for long.I had a really good friend all through elementary school, we went to an insanely strict Christian private school and her mother was a god damn freak. I actually got in trouble for saying "oh my god" and if I slept over we'd all join in the parents room and get on our knees and pray for like 5 to 10 minutes. She also never blinked which was weird AF but I couldn't stand her Have a link?

It only moves 1 foot away from where we normally keep it, so moving it back to where we want it isn't difficult.

If you're going to slow down the traffic in the through lane when there is a turn lane you are defeating the fucking purpose of the turn lane!

Also, loud talkers/laughers in a public setting. Speak at a volume that allows those that you're speaking to to hear you. Don't speak so god damn loud that you drown out every conversation within a 20 ft radius. This is related to those that laugh at 150 decibels and think that it's ok because they are laughing.Hitting my foot or something on an object.Parking.  
Apparently keeping it between the lines is a fucking mammoth task for most people.I hate it when the toilet paper fails and your hand gets shit on it. I feel unclean for the rest of the day/my life even after thoroughly washing.Chewing gum! My god I hate that shit.

Especially when I don't have a proper keyboard.The coffee machine in most hotels is often covered in mildew/mold/water stains from never being cleaned.

I get irrationally angry at how stupid it is.People walking slowStickers on consumer goods that don't peel off easily. fuck offIn my experience, the people who like to go on about what a "nice guy they are" are the true assholes. People tell me that I'm nice. I don't think I'm very nice.

There aren't things that I want to say. I believe if someone acts like an asshole, there's usually a deeper reason behind it.

Like, if Carol from work refuses to say, "Good morning" to me everyday, even though I say it to her. She ignores me. Instead of getting pissed off about it, I just imagine that maybe Carol grew up in an abusive home where her father beat her for talking in the mornings. That behavior is just ingrained in her and has nothing to do with me.

Most people who are assholes show anger. What we don't see is the sadness that's there as well.Nobody gives a fucking fuck about how fucking smart you think you are Brett.

YYEAAAAAH!A lot of stuff has been like that, but for some reason the movie Brother Bear has been the most time jump-y. I remember wanting to see it when it came out and I finally did watch it on Netflix the other day.

He died in the hospital on the night of march 3, while i was sleeping. When I woke up, I heard a lot of voices and when I got out of my room, there were so many lights and a huge crucifix in the living room. I knew it. I have to hold up my sadness because I was about to take my final examinations in my freshman high school year. Man, it was roughTwo years ago last month, my then-infant went into DKA and was mediflighted to a hospital 2 hours away. 

I can still relive every second of those two days - when she started to get ill, wouldn't sleep and wouldn't stop crying for a bottle but would vomit it up as soon as it came out of her mouth, taking her to an urgent care clinic, going to work, and then leaving early to join my husband with her at the ER. Arguing with the nurses there about the fact that my 4-month-old was non responsive, and the other people waiting telling me they wouldn't go until she was taken back. The nurse that took us back, hearing the doctors outside the door talking about DKA, googling it on my phone and realizing what it was, them taking her to a separate room to get her prepped for the helicopter. The hospital chaplain praying at us and being too numb too object. Watching her fly away. Rushing back to our house, we packed 3 cans of coke in a back pack we had because it was all that was cold, and then having to wait because my husband's family wanted to drive up too. Yelling at him for making me wait. Driving and just weeping. I was the first one in her room and she was asleep - they'd given her drugs - and she had I Vs and catheters everywhere, but she was breathing on her own and I was so happy. They brought me taco bell. I didn't eat it. The series premiere of Game of Thrones. I remember hearing about from a friend and thinking what a weird little nerdy show it was.

Even if you're fat and ugly, you'll look slightly less fat and ugly if you're working out.As soon as you can afford to. As soon as you have your shit together, maybe even before, they have put up with you for over a decade.Whenever you have a steady and sustainable income.As soon as you can afford to.

I understand times can be rough. The way I see it, if you have a job, even if its just a part time position and you're helping out by contributing to the finances, you're doing your part and I don't judge you. Hell, even if you're unemployed but you're busting your ass trying to find work and making up for being unemployed by helping clean and maintain the house as payment for staying there, I still wouldn't think any less of you.

If however, you're an uinemployed adult with no ambition content to leech off of mommy and daddy, I have no respect for you at all, or your parents for enabling you. Young children have more of my respect than people like this because at least they're going to school. When you have the resources to take care of yourself, or some sort of support structure.When you are ready or get kicked out.  I  hope my kid comes home after college. I like having young people home , fucking house filled with just old people is like the kiss of death.  When you're able to. It seems harder to move out and stay moved out at a younger age these days, and I know a lot of people in their mid-20s who lie at home. Many people here (UK) move away from home to go to university, but then move back home once they graduate. I wasn't able to move out until I was 25, and one of my sisters (27 this year) lives with my dad.

It's easier if you're in a relationship, as you can split rent/bills/mortgage deposit (though that's a big step for a couple, of course.)

If you're single, have a decent job and live at home, it might be a good idea to start saving for your own place.When you have the maturity, money, and resources to take care of yourself. The maturity part does increase by moving out, but you have to be able to take care of yourself. 

* Know how to cook, at the very least, a few basic and affordable meals. Taking care of yourself and staying in good health should be a huge priority as you'll be fully responsible for your own well-being. The healthier and more varied your cooking is, the happier you'll be.

* Know how to do household chores so that your new apartment (or other place of residence) won't end up trashed. If there's something really basic that you're not sure how to do, now is the time to figure it out. Also have knowledge of how to fix broken appliances or know who to call to fix them if they break, especially if the appliances weren't included with the property.

* Have a solid job, preferably something that pays over minimum wage so you can continue to support yourself (bills, general living expenses) as well as be able to take care of a potential emergency.

* Be good at making connections. While not mandatory, just being social will help you out a ton because if your apartment neighbors are friendly, they'll be more than willing to help you out in times when you're in need if you build friendships with them.

If you're going to college, live in a dorm for at least a year to get your feet wet and get a feel for living with less dependency on your family (depending on your situation and level of financial independence). Don't jump into getting an apartment, but at the same time don't stay at home if you're at a large university and within driving distance of home. In fact, many larger universities require freshmen to live on campus for their first year regardless.

If you have your shit together, moving out could end up being the best thing to ever happen to you.You may be living cheaply for a while, but the sense of freedom can be liberating and worthwhile.  If you're missing a factor from the list above however, especially if you're still relatively young, you might not be ready to move out for good just yet. Just have some common sense and know which risks to take, including the initial jump into living on your own.

Also, unless you're escaping from an abusive or otherwise toxic situation, don't be afraid to call on your parents if you really need their help. Yes you should be working towards your independence, but chances are they'll want to have your back if an emergency ever arises.When you find all your stuff packed up and waiting for you in the garage. I don't start raising my eyebrows until after you graduate college, maybe a year of wiggle room to find a job. 18Ever trusting a hook-nosed devil.

Getting into freemium games and IAP's. I don't spend more than I can afford to and I've cut down about 90% since I got married and started using YNAB. But I regret how much I've spent over the last 5 years or so. This too shall pass.If you can't make it, fake it.

Rule 1b: Never stand next to someone throwing shit at an armed man.

Rule 2: Never fire a laser at a mirror.Stacia! Stay determined!Hope for the best and plan for the worst.Chasers are for pussies.Girls peed out their butts. They do not have penises and sit down to pee. It was the only logical conclusion given the available evidence.I remember believing adults knew literally everything. That there was a finite amount of knowledge, and once you crossed some line and became an adult, you possessed all of it.

One day, I asked my mom a question, and she said, "I don't know."

That's the first time I can remember experiencing the emotion that can best be described as, "What the fuck, asshole?" I still believed adults knew everything, and I thought my mom was just being a jerk by claiming she didn't know the answer to my question.My father is from Trinidad, so I believed all fathers came from Trinidad. I mean, it only made sense, Trini-Dad. That I, single handedly came up with the theory of Pangea. I thought I was really on to something...I believed that a woman could get pregnant by just spending some time with a manI thought women threw up babies to give birthI was told that if you eat a seed, a tree grows out of your mouth.That i had two stomachs. One for dinner and one for desert2nd grade and there were three 4th grade guys bullying me for being gay. As a fan of storm, I thought i'd show them a piece of my power. So during lunch time i stood under a tree while they made fun of me and i look at the sky and attempted to cast wind, rain and lightning at them. Coincidentally, it rained hard and a storm happened at that moment. My classmates were so shocked. They asked if they could also get that power so they touched my palm one by one. Lol I thought that you had to touch your eyeballs every day or you'd go blind. 

So, I was maybe 3 years old, and one of my earliest memories is of standing in the bathroom next to mom when she was getting ready. She put her contact lenses in, but I couldn't see them, and didn't know that contact lenses existed.

"Why do you do that?" I asked. 

She replied, "So I can see,"  thinking, I'm sure, that I had seen the contacts.

But I hadn't, and with perfect kid logic, thought that you had to touch your eyes or you wouldn't be able to see, so I did that every morning until I was in first grade, when I stopped and I don't remember why. How I never got pinkeye is a total fucking mystery. My parents put a lot of emphasis on staying away from the train tracks (understandably). I came to the conclusion that it was because I was magnetic and I would stick to the tracks.  I genuinely used to believe that you could dig through the earth to reach China. A neighbor kid told me and naturally I considered him a reliable source as he was at least 2 years older. 

I spent almost 2 hours digging with a plastic toy shovel in our garden. I had gotten about a foot of depth when I realized it would be in vain as China was probably at least 5 or 6 feet deeper. That the moon and the sun were the same thing. I thought the sun turned around at night and what we saw as the moon was what was on the back. HopeI thought that when little girls grew up,  their nipples fell off, because Barbie dolls had no nipples. Maybe now they are more anatomically correct,  I haven't seen one in years. That adults were smart.You know how when you lay/sit on a body part for too long and it goes numb because of the lack of blood flow? People say "my (whatever body part) is asleep". When I heard this as a kid, I took it literally and thought that that part of my body had simply fallen asleep. So I used to go into the bathroom and put my foot/hand/arm into the sink and shake it under cold water to wake it up. I figured if it worked on people who were asleep, then it should work on my other body parts, too. 

This went on for years and my mom never corrected me. It wasn't until I was older and learned the science behind it in a class that I saw the light. I asked my mom why she never said anything and she responded with: "Well, I thought it was cute."As a kid who was allowed to watch whatever I wanted on TV, and not able to understand the jokes or anything said yet that revolved around sex, and had a lot of misconceptions. 
 The one that sticks out in my head was that Women were the one that wore condoms, since Samantha from sex and the city always bragged about having them. Oh, and I thought a yeast infection was from something you ate. 

  Also, I believed a lot of uncommon occurrences happened more often, very close to home. For example my mother make up something like "Don't walk off from me in the store. You'll get kidnapped, (My classmates mother) told me that (Classmate) walked off in the meat section and (mother) caught her being dragged away by a man while she was checking out"
  Insert that type of statement into anything dangerous for kids, and my dad wonders why I'm still shy and socially awkward. When women reached 30 they just became pregnant 

Also all my cousins lived very far away or in different countries so I thought a cousin was only called a cousin if they lived far away enough I believed that if you had a 'cancer' zodiac, it would mean that you actually had cancer, and those who had other zodiacs meant that they wouldn't get cancerI thought that if I got better grades, then my parents would be happy.
I thought that if I had more friends, then my parents would be happy.
I thought that if I got more awards, then my parents would be happy.

Finally I realized that my parents would never be satisfied - not happy - with me, and I needed to be the one that I was doing it all for.I believed that the bladder was essentially the "liquid stomach," as in, anything I drank went straight to my bladder instead of my stomach. I found out I was wrong when I asked one of my parents where ice goes.My dad told me that picking my nose would result in my head caving in. He used it as a scare tactic to stop me from doing it and it fucking worked, I was terrified. Long term it didn't work though because I realised he was bullshittingNot just as a kid, but well into my 20s. Somewhere as a child, I saw a movie or TV show that used Tapioca balls as fake fish eyes in a haunted house. Not sure how the wires got crossed, but from that point on I believed Tapioca was made of fish eyeballs. This leads to the inevitable moment two decades later, watching Good Eats with some friends and I say it out loud. Everyone looks at me like I'm a total moron. I thought girls peed out of their butti used to believe that certain people couldnt afford food so i purposely threw away food so they could eat that all the food i ate went into my stomach so they could go hang out and have funI believed that there was someone somewhere in the world who looked, thought and spoke just like me. If you eat a watermelon seed, a watermelon will grow in you, and you will need surgery to get it out. Siblings are terribleEveryone one else is a programmed robot except for meI (Caucasian female) thought I could grow up to be black. 

When I was in third grade we did a project one what we wanted to be when we grew up. By best friend was from Sudan and I wanted to look like her!I thought when an actor died in a movie, they died in real life.I thought there was a saint (insert name) day for every name like Saint Patrick's dayI used to run from the noise of the toilet flushing at night when I was a baby...That eating to much icing on top of cake would mean you shit worms.


Every story has a happily ever after ending. I thought that babies came out of the woman's ass. But, like, there was a special passage within the ass that makes it so that the baby isn't covered in shit on the way out.

I remember being horrified at 11 when I was in Sex Ed and learned that they actually come out of the vagina.My mom was showing me her green card and said it was her "alien card". For years I thought that meant she was an alien from outer space. GodAny announcement through a loudspeaker was from angels.I thought everything i ate was an ingrediant for making a cake by the tiny people in my stomach.[deleted]That having another cookie really would ruin my appetiteI believed that there were two demons who lived in my bathroom. Good times.trolls live under bridgesI couldn't grasp the concept of the same actor/actress being on two different channels at the same time. It was wizardry to me.My dad told me rocks grew in water. Believed that for longer than 
I'd like to admit.That I'm the only one who ages and I'd be older than everybody else. 

And that girls have a feminine dick.Chocolate milk comes from brown cowsEating raw cake batter would make me violently ill. Thought was impossible for adults to lie That girls don't fart.  
  
I remember once someone brought this up in a late evening congregation of guys. None of the guys had ever heard a girl fart. So we concluded only guys fart!If I work hard, I'll be able to achieve any of my dreams.If I swallowed bubblegum, a bubblegum tree would grow in my tummy.I thought one could live forever by eating only veggies.  My mom said we'd live forever if we did that.  Oh boy. I believed the red string in the band-aid wrapper was for giving yourself stitches 
That if I tried hard enough, my organs would come out if I pooped.I thought the song, [Dust on the bottle by David Lee Murphy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uNkF_ZpQ4eg), was about a car until I was twenty or so.They if you opened all the car doors the car would fly Santa Clause.  I believed that a man delivered presents to children around the world in one night.  What a dweeb.I thought the war on drugs seemed silly...because they could just close the drug stores. I thought aircraft warning lights on tall structures were heaven. Because I thought each pulsing light was someone in heaven, I also believed only a handful of people had ever made it there (or passed away). My family encouraged this belief by telling me one light was my great   grandmother.That I owned the Pacific Ocean. I always referred to it as my ocean. Must have been 13 before I realized that it didn't, in fact, belong to me.I would say Pokemon but it's realI thought the sounds of Mourning Doves were owls.As a kid I went to supplementary classes on Saturdays and one time whilst carpooling with the kids of my parent's friends we passed by an adult video store. I asked the kids what an adult video was and them being about 18 or so, they said they were boring black and white films for adults. Boring adults? Boring films? I put 2 and 2 together and believed them. Due to growing up in a Christian family, we heard all sorts of things as kids that they tell you to make you believe in God from a young age. 

I remember my grandma telling my two older sisters and I that we lived in Heaven with God before we came to be here on Earth. I was around four, maybe five at the time, and I remember finding a picture of my sisters and I dressed as angels, posed on a "cloud" pillow with clouds behind us. Naturally, I assumed it was a picture of us chillin' in Heaven before LIFE life. 

I even went so far as to argue with a classmate or two about it, saying I had proof that we'd already been to Heaven. Somehow, that's where the memory ends- I have no idea if I ever brought the picture. Now that I think of it, though, I may have brought it and lost it, and that's why I never saw that picture again. I have no idea. All I know is I feel ridiculous looking back, because I mean, my oldest sister is five years older than me, and she's obviously a little kid in the picture, not a baby like my other sister and I. What, did she just get to live in Heaven for way the fuck longer? Alright then.

I was a valued customer when I was on hold. That life was fair.Because of those Sesame Street educational bits, I thought that all food was created in factories. That they just put food together somehow and churned it out into tins. My mother took me to a petting zoo when I was 4 one day and after we were eating some chicken and I realized it was the same word as those animals I'd spent all day petting and running after, so I asked my mother where did this chicken come from, did it come from a factory? And she explained that no, it was from actual chickens. That they had to kill it and we were eating it there. That was the last time I ever ate meat. It horrified me that this is how people lived. That we'd kill something to eat it. 

When I was about 2 or 3 my mother also took us to see Santa at a department store. I guess there'd been a recent Batman movie because outside was a guy dressed up as Batman taking photos with people. I loved that camp old Batman TV series and was in awe of seeing the real Batman out in person but when my mother tried to get us close to take photos I started crying because I was so intimidated by him and couldn't handle getting close. But afterwards for a few years, I believed that Santa and Batman actually lived in that department store, and everytime we'd visit I'd run about looking under furnishings or behind pillars for clues of where they were hiding. I thought I'd stumble upon them just chilling out I guess in their off time.I believed that we would never die, once our parents got old they would become kids again until it was our turn.Once I finally found out who my birth father was, I had this strange sense of hero worship in my head. Maybe it was because it was such a relief to find out that my dad wasn't my mother's first husband and I glamourized their relationship today, as well as believed that I could hear him when I was in this very fucked up state.

I don't know what flipped the switch, but I went from admiration to pure rage and anger. He spent so much of his life on drugs and they meant more to him than my mother, his own life and me. He told my mother not to tell anyone I was his. He died from AIDS from using heroin. He was a pure addict and that's the man that I came from. I would do anything to find out why he was so ashamed of me. 

I'm getting married next week and today, after watching that damn Fresh Prince scene we all know, I wonder the same thing. Why didn't he want me? And yet, in a way, I know. Because he was dying and just wanted the drugs.

My mom eventually married an awesome person who is my dad now and although we're not always super close, I love him like he was my biological father. So, my stupid thing to believe was that my birth father was some kind of amazing person to worship when all he was was a drug addict who left my mom and I to die for his habits.I used to think there was a huge test at the end of college on literally everything you have learned so far in life.That the foo fighters were originally called "food fighters" until one of their members left, taking the d with him.That babies came from the mother's ass. And that was actually taking it UP a notch. I've been told that I at a very early age thought babies came out a person's mouth.I was raised Catholic, and apparently took things very literally. When my mother told me the Tabernacle was the house of God, I literally believed there was a tiny Jesus living in there, like Jeanie in her bottle. In my head I had even decorated it with mid-century modern furniture. That everyone is does something one could consider immoral does it because they're insecure. That's the most stupid belief you could have.I know fluids had to be exchanged during sex but...
I thought the male had to wait until he needed to pee, and then he would go inside the girl. Come to find out...I thought that Mt Shasta (a volcano) would randomly sprout out of a "Shasta Road" nearby.

...just because they had the same names.  

-

They were nowhere near each other, aside from being in the same State.Thought hub caps were actual wheels. That teachers didn't have first namesThat pregnant women had to have the baby cut out of them. This explained why women had to go to hospital and why lots of women used to die in childbirth.

A lot of things I believed when I was a kid were pretty close to the truth.I believed that if I spun my arm around fast enough, it would take me back in time.   

I thought that babies came out of the mom's naval. It made total sense at the time - the belly gets huge, and there's already kind of a hole there. I don't know if someone told me this or if I just made that up myself because it seemed logical.I thought that handicapped parking spaces were given to handicapped people just as a nice gesture because they are handicapped and you wanted to make them feel good. I didn't realize that they actually needed to be closer because they had mobility issues. 

I don't know what I'm talking about. I watched the movie 3 Amigos and there were couple of scenes where people casually shoot up a bar and kill a bunch of people and no one seemed to care much.  I deduced that killing people was legal in the olden days.  Must have sucked to live in the olden days. When I was really little I fucking loved dinosaurs and would watch Jurassic Park on VHS all the time because of the dinosaurs. In order to get me to nap my mom told me that at the same time everyday dinosaurs would come down our street and eat all the kids out playing. The only safe place? Under the blankets in my bed. I was like three or four

When I was younger I got a job as a firefighter knowing it would be hard, and I would see some unpleasant things. I never believed it would affect me. I eventually wound up a borderline alcoholic after a few years because of three calls that really fucked me up and not talking about them. It's all good now, but know that shit sneaks up on you, and keep an eye out for it because it hits hardJesusJesusNothing says badass like proper punctuation.Because without punctuation everything just runs together and in the end youre left wondering if the person is done talking or died while writing It adds an air of finality to your statement. Because periods are badass.Proper use of punctuation is inherently bad ass.Because proper grammar, punctuation and spelling makes you sound like an intelligent adult.My old boss never did any work, was seriously incompetent, and took credit for what everyone else did so he would get a better end of year evaluation and raise. Had a GM at a restaurant at some point who would take it out on others when he was not having a good day.

And had a nasty habit of publicly humiliating you when you made a mistake rather than talking to you about it afterward, or even in a more calm tone for that matter.I worked as a gas attendant for three years, one day my boss quit and we were given a new one. This fat sack of useless smelly shit didn't know ANYTHING about the business. Always calling me in and having me do things that were supposed to be done by himself. 

He stole money from the registers, blamed everyone for the problems and took no responsibility for his own actions. We had a customer email corporate and tell them that he was just standing around while we all ran our asses off trying to get work done. 
He said that it wasn't his fault that we were busy. 

He delivers phonebooks now.

Bitch. My old boss was one of those who always did everything better than you. According to her telling you that of course, never saw it in person. But when she worked in Manchester, before taking this job in London, she did what we did and boy did she do it so much better than us! 

Also, I was the only parent in our team. She told me she wasn't maternal and she never believed when the nursery would call me and ask me to collect my unwell child. So much so that she made me share an office with her so she could hear the phone calls. When my 3yr old son broke his femur, she couldn't understand why the hospital said I had to stay with him while he was an inpatient for 6 weeks and then she couldn't understand what he couldn't go straight back to nursery and therefore me back to work when he was discharged. She refused to believe that he needed to relearn to walk and use his muscles after 6 weeks in bed, I should be at work goddamit! 

Crux of it came when he was 4yrs and got Meningitis. Boss made me take unauthorised and unpaid leave as it was only months after taking time off for his broken leg. I jacked the job in there and then. 

Found out a couple of years later she was pregnant and was working from home. WORKING FROM HOME? FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BEING PREGNANT? FUCK YOU BITCH. I hope her kid has many, many common childhood illnesses (ones that don't harm the child but mean the nursery won't take it and she has to be off work).

I know that if I don't take care of my son, he'll go without the things he needs. When his father isn't home, it's up to me to feed him, to comfort him when he's scared, to bathe him, etc. The simple fact is, if I don't, no one will. I'm not going to let my son go without things he needs because of my feelings or my struggles, no matter how intense they may be.  
Life is cruel and there will be many times when he doesn't have everything he needs, and won't have someone to comfort him or help him. If I have my way, he'll never experience those things because of me.I became an actor, I smile and laugh and pretend to be normal, they got to bed and I breakdown, repeat as needed...A lifeIf each point is worth one USD, I can get myself a coffee and maybe a chocolate bar.

They've made me realize that most of the world's problems are the result of greed and hatred.  Love one another, we're all brothers and sisters in this world.  David Bowie. Prior to being introduced to him, I hadn't actually been exposed to androgyny or anything "weird." To be fair, I was only a little child and lived in a small town at the time, but as soon as I came across him I became obsessed. He's helped me realise that it doesn't matter if you are a bit odd, weird or different, and that you can still flourish being yourself.

RIP.K.Will and BTS changed my life severely. They're foreign music artists so you probably haven't heard of them haha but they really helped me :')Acrania <3Regina Spektor - particularly her [Far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9nU0NSubk) Album.

Each song has held a lesson I've taken to heart.  I started listening to her just before I moved to college, and throughout college, so I believe a lot of the value of those songs are caught up in my personal experiences as I was really coming into my own person.

I don't believe her songs will have the same impact on you in one listen.  They have a good message though, and someday I promise you'll find some application for them in your life!The Wiggles. No explanation needed. Phish.  They're incredibly versatile and play a wide range of styles and all incredibly well, and as a result have introduced me to a lot of music, both specific bands and genres that I now love.The two biggest artists that changed my life are an unlikely pair - Michael Jackson and Radiohead. Grew up with MJ but really became a fan around age 10. He could write songs in every style with incredibly meaningful lyrics and complex compositions. He has a song for everyone if they look hard enough, and truly was an artist through and through. 

Radiohead came much later. Alternative/rock music was not played in my house very often, and I heard Creep for the first time a couple years ago and have been hooked ever since. They too have meaningful lyrics and compositions that completely blow my mind. Like MJ, I hear something new with each listen. Moody Blues...Days of the Future Past. My mom had just died. I would crank up my quadraphonic stereo and get lost in the music. I had saved my babysitting money for this and could only afford one record. I could cry without being heard. Todd Rundgren. Was my childhood hero. I absorbed his POV pretty much subconsciously and I doubt he and I would disagree on much of anything politically and spiritually. My first sentence was I want a beet.


I used to catch turtles, spray paint them gold and try to sell them.
 

In school I got in trouble once for saying I was going to dig up the remains of Harry Truman on a field trip.

One day , for reasons I dont remember,  me and another kid stripped every piece of  bark from a tree in the neighbors yard.  It looked pretty striking, a bright white tree.   After my folks told me it was a  bad idea to do it,  I was scared that the neighbor would be really pissed. He never mentioned it.




I got sent to Bible school a few times. One day they gave us an assignment where we were supposed to draw a picture of sinners. Now, I could come up with something a lot better that what I did then.  Something like see, these are the people of Sodom and  theyre trying to force the Virgin Mary  to give a goat a rim job on the Sabbath.  But, back then what I drew was a bunch of kids smiling and  dancing around Satan who,  for reasons I dont remember,  was spinning  a basket ball on his finger. After we finished our pictures we had a little picnic outside. They had this little fire going in a grill and everyone was supposed to throw your  picture into the fire so wed learn what happens to sinners once they die. I didnt want to burn my  picture, so when it was my turn I doused the fires of hell with a  mouthful of fruit punch. That was the last day I went, but  I dont  remember if it was their idea or mine.

Got very mad when my mother wouldn't let me dye my hair black so I could look more like Elvis.  I was 6 at the time. 


I could go on.I used to beat myself with my hairbrush when I couldn't get the tangles out. I had some anger control issues as a kid. I used to throw things, slam doors, yell, and chase my sister with kitchen knives. I threw a pair of scissors and a chair at some kid who pissed me off in year 7, I like to think I've mellowed out since then..... sortaMy old brother tried to kill me several times.I can't really do math anymore, but my hair looks damn good. Deodorant and matches and branches. (On concrete, definitely didn't want to set fire to the garden accidentally and I never did, thankfully.)

Many, *many* instances of self mutilation, before I was depressed. Continued afterwards but at least then I was hurting myself for a reason instead of ... well no reason at all I guess. psycchos don't know they are psychosConvince people that you are the last prophet of God. As you gain followers, form an army of warriors but preach peace. Slowly expand your followers by asking small local groups to convert. If the group refuses, kill all the Men and enslave the women and children. Use the women to produce more children and raise all the children as followers and warriors. Repeat the process in ever increasing populations. When you reach 25% of the population you will have achieved critical mass. Send your warriors throughout the world as refugees to spread your culture. Create local centers of training and government disguised as places of worship. Create groups disguised as charities to raise money. Direct your followers to get jobs in their host countries as policemen, cab drivers, food service, civil service, media, and education. Follow Saul Alinsky's "Rules for Radicals" to get people to cave in to your demands. Continue to preach peace while weak, but as you gain strength prepare to wage war both physically and mentally. Be patient, there will be setbacks. You will eventually prevail. 

This is a fictitious scenario. Any resemblance to an actual scenario to take over the world is purely coincidental.Start a company that makes cool revolutionary products and gains the world's trust. Start a Hydraulic Press Channel on YouTube.Become a politician by giving people free stuff then let a bunch of terrorist into the country under the guise of compassion and when they kill citizens I will tell them that we need to replace their sovereignty with security.Don't piss off Ghandi and take it from there.Make a movement that pushes a cute an innocent culture. Like Japan. Plant the idea that cute is the needed utopia needed to make us happy. Have representatives that live by the cute lifestyle present the benefits of it. Grow a following. Break gender roles and sexuality with the idea that we are all just colors and these colors are pastel. Mass advertise public figures joining the cute movement.   Mass production of common products in pastel colors to support the cute movement.  Push the idea that humans are colors and we should work together to be a successful rainbow. Start to inject fear. Godliness is cleanliness and those who  reach this can be the up most cute. Advertise cute propaganda and use what isn't cute the equivalent of anti godliness. Plant the idea that cuteness is liberating. Create a leader for the movement who is youthful, full faced and looks questionably childlike. Have them speak in the behalf of the movement. Using someone as innocent and childlike would only cause people to idolize her innocence due to the media grooming that cuteness is godliness. She now rules a great amount of people. Stage crisis actors for the media to capture how cuteness can save lives. Create indigenous people propaganda, displaying how cuteness must be reached to these lands. create an organization to collect funds. Open church like facilities to preach about our new leader and the cute movement. Let it snowball. Create the 'snitcher' app.

We're all Kindgerterners at heart who love to tattle on one another. Basically it would turn the world into East Germany under the STASI. Everyone would be so petrified of getting turned into the authorities, that I could easily use my inexhaustible list of informants to blackmail public officials and gain power for myself.

Start in Madagascar False flag nuclear attacks in major cities around the world. Force governments into an international coalition, united under the threat of apocalyptic terrorism. Depends on what country I am.

As the US I would do just about everything to maintain the current status quo. I would keep destabilizing countries not aligned with the US such as Syria, Libya, Iraq under Saddam, North Korea, etc. I would keep our military way stronger than the rest of the world and use it to flex our muscles worldwide and counter any expansion from countries such as China or Russia. I would also control the media to brainwash as many people as I can to make people distrust Russia, China, and any other country not aligned with the US. I would especially take advantage of Hollywood and promote movies with villains from these countries. 

If I were Germany I would keep pushing to get more and more power in the EU by weakening individual member states.  I would definitely use the European migration crisis as a weapon to weaken individual member states.  Then once power is consolidated in Germany I would expand the EU to allow non European states to join but they'd have to give up their sovereignty. 

If I were China I would push to increase the population of China then pressure other countries to take in Chinese immigrants. Especially western countries with low birthrates such as Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, etc. since they seem to be most vulnerable to this tactic due to being more liberal than the rest of the world. Over time the Chinese immigrants would replace more and more of the natives and would likely vote for their own candidates in these countries who would likely be more willing to cooperate with China. Then I'd make some kind of union with these countries with power consolidated in China. 

As India I would have the same plan as China except before I push immigration into western countries I'd instill nationalism into my people to get the same results. The Chinese are already fairly nationalistic so I wouldn't need to instill nationalism into the Chinese people before sending them to live in other countries.

As Saudi Arabia I would first invest a lot of money into developing technologies that I can sell worldwide in order to reduce our reliance on oil.  I would especially invest in alternative energy sources such as nuclear or solar. I would keep oppressing women and keep them as second class citizens and use them to keep making more children and oppose any and all forms of feminism in Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries in order to keep the population growth of the Islamic world increasing. I would also fund mosques in other countries especially western countries that push extremist Islamic ideologies and I would also push for immigration from Islamic countries into western countries.  I would even try to make the European migration crisis even worse by spreading more lies to Africa and the Middle East about how Europe will take in all these people and I would even fund their migration. Over time these immigrants will replace many of the natives of these western countries and vote in their own politicians into office who will be aligned with Saudi Arabia.  Once these countries are taken over I would use them to put economic, political, and military pressure against stronger non-Islamic countries that likely wouldn't have fallen for my immigration scheme such as Russia, China, Japan, Taiwan, and South and North Korea.

Meanwhile most people will say killing is a more serious decision but in a panic situation you're not going to think about legal ramifications or moral quandaries, you're just going to react. 

So I'll say you are going to more readily kill for someone or something than die for them.  I'm willing to die for something, I won't be doing it without killing someone first. Die.

You can kill many people (although this is rarely a good idea), but you can die only once.Dying for sure. It's the ultimate sacrifice I'm willing to kill for a lot more reasons than I'm willing to die forThere's a philospophical question about whether it is worse to suffer injustice or commit it (think Shakespeare's slings and arrows of defeat). I took a Rhetoric class in college, and we discussed it in more detail. I remember the professor argued from the standpoint of preserving your reputation/humanity/soul. Basically if you commit the injustice (kill) your soul bares that mark forever. If you suffer the injustice, it is the other party that bares that mark. From that viewpoint, I'd say that I'd die for something before I'd kill for it, but I doubt that I'd have the guts to go through with it in a real life situation.Dying is an eternal, unrecoverable event, killing is an action that you are capable of rationalizing away.

Legion.School basically caused me to stop playing.  I would start again if I had more free time I stopped playing because all games are the same, what would get me back?.. Lack of good stuff on Netflix.Figured I need to get a life. I also discovered video games were holding me back and limiting my relationships.Without trying to sound overly dramatic - realising life is the best game of them all. Theres a lot out there to see, do and stick your penis in.I found a wife I actually want to spend time with. I used video games as a way to avoid my ex-wife. I stopped gaming and drinking alcohol 4 months ago, after it nearly got me killed.  Because I am addicted to both of those. Hopefully nothing gets me back into gaming ! Kids, free time Nothing beats the original Unreal Tournament during high school (for me).. #KoA for life, had a great team and we had fun. I'd love to play a game with those I did before!! We spent years playing a game as teammates, or enemies, love to hear from them.  After this game nothing seemed the same.
Edit: anyone apart of zpworld?You tend to age out of gaming as you get older and take on more responsibility. The jadedness you feel with industry bullshit combines with the increased weight of adulthood and lack of free time, and it's not a sudden epiphany of insight, but more like a gradual weakening of your will to commit to another grindy JRPG when there are already six other unplayed games in your Steam library. I'll be 28 next week and I think at some point in the past year I've become the filthy casual I spent most of my youth alienating. I still love my games as a means to unwind, and whenever I have an hour free I'll beat the skins on Rock Band or do a couple of rifts in Diablo, but I'm happy with the balance I've struck with my life :)

Edit: redundancyGames weren't as open world as rl and would quickly become boring cause of that. They started to all feel like the same shit with different coverThey closed down City of Heroes, and I never found anything that was as satisfying.

Reopening City of Heroes would probably get me back in, but there's always the chance it'd shut down again, so I don't really know...

My adopted sister. It was my first year teaching middle school; I was 22 and one year removed from college.  I admit I was learning the craft, and was pretty poor at it.  I volunteered to coach the soccer team, and one of the parents said to me at the end of the soccer season pizza party, "You are a horrible person and teacher!"  I will never forget the way she said it, and I still think about that conversation even though it was fifteen years ago."You are a hypochondriac of mental illness."

We do so many stupid things because if it and in the end it's just an exercise in anxiety and a waste of the little life we do have. Willful ignorance.  How some people can go through life acting as if their beliefs are fact and anything and everyone who disagrees with them is wrong is baffling to me.  It's okay to be wrong, and God isn't going to send you to Hell for accepting the theory of evolution, or letting gay people get married.Morality.Natalie Portman Natpo 100%natalieDefinitely Natalie Portman If I was about to be the last human, then neither of them could be alive...  or human. Since Scarlett Johansen is really an alien covered in a human skin suit, I guess she's the only choice.

But really, Scarlett come on people, XONatalie Portman. Without a doubt. Why do you ask.... ?It depends, can I play the role of "Shark?"

I would honestly eat either. Let them fight to the death over it, survivor gets fed to the sharks.Portman because she doesn't have herpes.Definitely Scarlett Johansson. Black Widow or Thor's girlfriend? The choice is obvious. You should be happy with yourself before you even think of being with someone else, so yes...you can definitely be happy single.I think so. 

My aunty is approaching 60. She was divorced in her early 20's and has not had a relationship since. She is loving life. You don't even need friends either. As much as I wish I could say yes you shouldn't feel the need to be in a relationship, you're friends (no matter how close) can't always be there for you in the darkest hour of the night when you wake up sweating.If you're happy and single, you're actually less likely to *remain* single. Only if you're happy with yourself can you form a healthy relationship with somebody else.[removed]I hope soYup, until your friends get sick of you.Happiness must come from inside, not from the people around you. If you keep trying to become a better person and do what you like you can be happy nonetheless. Sure, may not even need friends to be happy.I couldn't but everyone is different and wants different things in life.  I guess the real question is can you?I've been married and I am currently single with a wonderful SO who lives elsewhere and we're both very happy. We've been "an item" for over 20 years.

They are not especially rare, or unique.  Just a monopoly and propaganda.The city of Chicago was raised by several feet during the 1860s without disrupting daily life or businesses closing down to solve a drainage problem. Entire buildings, shopping centers, sidewalks and hotels were all lifted up manually by laborers using jackscrews while people went about their daily lives, shopped and dined. In one case, a large hotel was raised off the ground even while guests stayed on oblivious of what was going on underneath them:

Creed BrattonCreed from the Office. His little comments and business venturesOne Piece- Ussop, Naruto- Might GuyMy favorite movie is The Shining. Everyone goes on about the creepy twins, or the rotting woman in the bathroom...but Joe Turkel as Lloyd the bartender never gets brought up and I think he's incredibly creepy. He never does anything outright malicious, just smiles, stares, pours you a drink and makes small talk, yet there's this ominious undercurrent to his character where you KNOW something isn't right and he could do terrible things if he wanted. He's easily my favorite character in the movie. i think carl from the walking dead is shit on too much. yeah, he's whiny and has trouble listening to adults, but to be fair he's a child that lives with the fear of the undead that had to [kill his own mother, for gods sake](/spoiler)Breaking Bad, Mike :((Creed from The Office

far and away the most funny characterI'm not sure this fits your description but I love how 9 x anything will equal 9, and has one number below. (Ex 9 x 3.. 27. 2 + 7 = 9) Just a rhyme. 6 and 8 went on a date, then they come back, 48.Not really mental,  but the hand/finger trick is cool for doing multiplication with 9s. I never learned this while in school. Sure would have helped. Abacus training. Enough practice, and you don't even need the abacus anymore. Calculating percents.  Maybe not a cool trick, but it sure is helpful for calculating restaurant tips or store discounts.  Knowing that X percent of Y is Y percent of X. So instead of trying to find 16% of 50 for example, just divide 16 by 2 and you find that the answer is 8.So many good ones... I'm a suckered for rom-coms. 

My favorite is probably "The truth about cats and dogs" movie was really well cast,  and had a super sweet story. Chasing Amy, because Batfleck doesn't get the girl in the end. Sabrina.  Because sometimes the person we have loved our whole life isn't really our soulmate. Good Luck Chuck, its a calm Dane Cook and actually pretty good. Upon reviewing the trailer I realize that I haven't seen a trailer like this in looooong time. Did movie voice guy get fired?

When I was in High School evolution was a short talk on how humans came from whales.  It was interesting, but in a conservative small town it seemed kind of laughable.

In college I was shown how some members of one bacteria were immune to something that killed other bacteria.  Those bacteria lived on to reproduce and were immune to the killing method.

The biggest flaw in modern education is not in the content, but in the focus. Grades are in focus, not knowledge.

You're studying towards a final test/exam with the goal of getting a passing grade - the goal of school is not knowledge, which is sadI will go first; I think that basic survival should be taught.  We as a society have become too dependent on grocery stores, readily available fresh water, the power grid, and more conveniences of modern life, and I feel that the youth need to be educated on how to survive without these things in the case of an apocalyptic scenario. How to make decisions, both consumer decisions and moral decisions.Basic cooking skills, sewing, basic personal finance, actual sex ed.voting, and politicsITT- stuff kids in school won't care about Things you should never buy: lottery tickets, payday loans, homeopathic remedies, etcI show Hitler a WWII documentary and convince him that treating jews badly is a mistake, they develop the atomic bomb and that invading Russia was a mistake.

Despite growing up poor for a large portion of my childhood while he fought for his VA benefits (medically discharged from the Air Force because of said MS) my dad was always a pillar of strength and support in my life and did his best to give me whatever he could. I first heard that song as a child when he took me to see the animated Hercules movie, and to this day it chokes me up because, despite the gradual loss of his mobility and then health, he will always be like Hercules to me.Because of you - Kelly Clarkson.

I really loved the song before things happened and now I can't stand hearing it.Xerces - DeftonesIt's Quiet Uptown from the Hamilton soundtrack. Absolutely devastating.Bette Midler - The RoseHorizons - Puscifer.

Just hearing it in my head now is making me tear up."Let your heart hold fast" by Fort Atlantic.One Last Goodbye by Anathema. Pretty much anything made by the musician C418.

Especially his song [Alpha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLfm2nnCOpc), which contains things mixed from several of his other songs, mixed beautifully.*Hate Me* - Blue October

My ex and I had a VERY nasty breakup two years ago. I was going through my own problems and she sacrificed everything to help me through them. Still, I didn't see how much she actually sacrificed, or the damage I had caused her mentally and emotionally. I just kept on doing what I was doing. Eventually she couldn't take it anymore and we had a horrible breakup that ended in me having a complete emotional breakdown. 

Every time we cross back into each other's lives, she slips back a little bit into the damaged mess she was by the end of our relationship.

It'd be easier for her if she would hate me for the damage that I have caused her, but she won't, and so as much as I still love her, I have to let her go - perhaps permanently - so she can finish healing, and she can be everything she has the potential to be without me.

I saw them live a few weeks ago and I broke down into tears when they played that song because I had this realization.
Routine by Steven Wilson. The video is such a sad and powerful song. An absolute masterpiece**[The Hymn of Acxiom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mvrKfcOnDg)**, by Vienna Teng, is a piece that is sung from the perspective of a (real) supercomputer that exists within an (equally real) analytics and marketing company. Said company - Acxiom - is one of those incredibly eerie establishments that *sounds* like it dabbles in science fiction, in that they know everything about you and can tailor advertising to specifically catch your eye.

They're like the corporate version of the NSA, basically.

Anyway, the song itself comes across as being a description of how this company operates, and it's a very compelling message. Beneath the surface, though, there's something hauntingly touching about how the computer thinks. The last lines of the song, for instance, are "Is that wrong? Isn't this what you want?" While you *could* take that with a mocking tone, to my ear it sounds more like a suggestion that this computer is struggling towards sentience, using its programming as the basis for its fledgling mind... and like all entities, it has a longing for companionship. 

We, as humans, would view its actions as being deplorable (or at the very least, creepy), but *it* is doing what it thinks is necessary to garner approval.

The Hymn of Acxiom is a warning... but it's also a love song, with the purest and most evocative sense of longing that I've ever encountered in a piece of music.

**TL;DR: The Hymn of Acxiom can touch even an electronic heart.**Eva Cassidy - Time after time

Iris - Goo Goo Dolls or Don't Wanna Miss a Thing by Aerosmith. Years ago, too many years ago, I suffered through an unexpectedly soul-searing Christmas day at the hands of my own family. On the way back to my own apartment that night, puttering through the back streets, i was on autopilot from the shock. And then i heard a song i hadn't heard in ages- a particular choir version of Little Drummer Boy. I promptly dropped out of autopilot and cruised straight into full-on tears. I recovered my composure just before i parked at the complex, then walked up to the back/front door of my empty apartment. Except that it wasn't empty: a couple of my friends who i'd given a key had gotten sick of their own families and let themselves in to play Tekken.  By the time they left, i was sore from laughing so hard.  So it all ended on a good note. And every Christmas season since then,  i always seem to stumble across the same version of that song on my car radio once, sometimes twice. And it pulls me back to that day and night without fail, complete with borderline tears followed by an inside smile. *Linkin park - the end

My mother is a narcissist who loves no one but herself. I have no other family, and I have no friends or SO. Every person I've gotten close to has left me. Never fails. But the sad part is I'm not smart enough to stop letting people get close to meMy mind is literally killing itself. Mental issues destroy your life.I've pretty much fallen in love with a girl I might never actually meet face-to-face. My mother's health has been on a rapid decline the past few years. She's not that old either (53) and it both scares me and depresses me worrying that she might not be around much longer. My sister and I have started helping her out financially because she can no longer work. I love her and have no problem at all helping her in any way I can, but that depresses me in a way also...mainly thinking "I didn't think the moment the children would be taking on the supportive role instead of the parent would come this quickly." My mother was always a very strong and stubborn woman, and I hate seeing her deteriorate. My mum is disabled, I'm essentially a carer for her, I'm struggling to get a job (had an interview recently though yay), and we don't get on very well at all.Betwen the ages of about 11 to 19 my dad would tell me every day that he hated me.I miss my voices. They were my friends. The Girls have been gone for years. I really want to talk to my (alien) sister, but she only talks to me when I have a schizophrenic relapse. So, being able to talk to her isn't advised. I miss them so much though.People who believe they are unlucky are actually shooting themselves in the foot. Beyond the fact there's no such thing as luck and you might as well believe in the tooth fairy, those who think of themselves as unlucky are more likely to miss opportunities and hold themselves down vs. people who view themselves as lucky are far more likely to be successful just because they're more likely to put themselves out there.

Luck is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You decide what box you want to put yourself in. Think positive thoughts. You don't, luck is by definition outside your control. Focus instead on the things you *can* change.MeditateYou'll never feel unlucky if you never feel slighted by the random occurrences in your daily life.

i love tattoos but those ribbons on the back of the thighs? almost always a sign of trash of some kind. my opinion at least but hey, sometimes trash is hot...Tramp stamps. My mom had one. When I was a kid I didn't realize how trashy it was but as an adult... Yea my mom was a slutBetty Boop anythingMore tattoos than teeth. I was going to go into a whole list of things, then I realized all you need to do is go to a 7-11 at about 30 minutes before beer sales close. It's the reason why we call it the trash runPeople who buy tacky jewelry or accessories for their pets. My old neighbor had a shitty fake rolex his boxer would wear.

Disclaimer-I'm not bashing people for needing food stamps. I think they're absolutely necessary for lower income people. But have some priorities. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE LIVE-IN NURSE AND HER HUSBAND THAT LIVE WITH MY SENIOR FATHER.

-- Way overly friendly. Share family secrets when first meeting someone.
-- Every story they have to share is about how something/someone pissed them off.
-- Every conversation must revolve around them. Cut others off to redirect the conversation back to them.
-- Inane recital of every trivial mundane thing they've done in the past day like it high drama and adventure.
-- Use a chamber pot in their bedroom and don't dump it out all day. Letting the stench of their shit permeate the entire home.
-- Blame the stench of their shit filled room on a rotting cabbage they found in their closet.
-- Never wash their hands after aforementioned chamber pot and prepare food with bare hands. Hand far more involved in the cooking process than normal.
-- Leave uncovered, oozing and bloody raw meat on counter, and in refrigerator. Dried blood all over other items in fridge. Raw chicken blood ooze all over kitchen table and floor.
-- Find out they NEVER wash food while preparing it. Never wash produce or poultry. 
-- Never drain the fat off of ground beef. So, they frequent Hamburger Helper they love is a solid gelatinous mass once chilled in the fridge.
-- Rotting food is seldom cleaned out of the fridge or storage. Oozing rotted produce is the norm and can sit for months.
-- She works in a local burger fast food. Has passed mandatory food handling classes.
-- Cooks 6 lbs of hamburger for a SINGLE meal for 4 people. My father and their daughter eat 1 burger. The remaining 5.5 lbs are eaten by the parents.
-- Has surgery on her foot and quickly gains 50+ pounds. Pushes her healing far faster then doctors recommend. Want to sue doctors for second surgery after she failed to take care of  herself.
-- Tells everyone about how much weight she is loosing because her pants are now so loose. But, pants are home made polyester (bright fuchsia) and the small elastic waist band is complete destroyed and stretched out.  
-- Brags to all her friends that she will soon be on Social Security Disability because her doctors botched her foot surgery.
-- Buys daughter her own container of ice cream. The very next day it is missing and the parents blame it on my father (who loves ice cream but only a single serving at a time.) She find empty ice cream container in their bedroom trash. Daughter is punished because she is upset by what they did.
-- Husband "works full time" which ends up being around 1-2 days a month.
-- Family goes to hospital 5-6 times EACH MONTH! Any trivial reason. They consider it a form of status and brag to their friends about it. Medicare pays all their medical bills.
-- Saves up excess antibiotics "just in case" They offer them to friends as a remedy to just about anything. 
-- Spends 6-9 months of every years with a prescription of antibiotics for one thing or another.
-- Collects Dukes of Hazard memorabilia. 

(This is just a brief list from the past 3 months. My father feels bad for them and wont kick them out, even though they having paid their $300 rent in over 9 months.)

Any camo. Especially with some sort of pink too. Blue Eye shadow that is overdone.Any combination of the following:

Inability to speak properly or enunciate
Wearing hair rollers / pajamas in public

Neck/face tattoos
Smoking with one hand and carrying a child with the other
Being excessively loud/vulgar in grocery stores or public in generalOpen toed shoes, crop top or maybe a button up tied at the midriff, denim shorts that aren't quite short shorts but instead one or two sizes too small because she bought them while she was in her prime three or four kids ago. Potentially pregnant, potentially smoking a cigarette, probably both, all while shouting at her kids and looking for her husband who hates his life.Neck tattoos
Tramp stamp, or Trump stamp. I mean sticker, but either way. Not getting through the day without smoking at least two packs of cigarettes or going through a can of chew, and an unkempt mulletBadly done tattoos in visible places, the inability to use an inside voice, smoking, walking around in public with a silk cap, and having loud speaker phone conversations in public.my ex best friend had a long term boyfriend who was insanely jealous. one time he "caught" her with a friend he didn't like her hanging out with and attacked him with crowbar when he found out. Trash at its finest.Hanging out at a convenience store at night like it is a social spot.  Either alone and annoying the clerk and customers or hanging around with other people.

Edit: the ONLY way I would even halfway give people who do this a pass is if it is the only place open in a really tiny podunk town. Can't blame them then.Guys that try to wear pants but cant seem to pull them up. Tattoo on your neck, bonus if its a "sexy" phrase.A tattoo above or on the genitalia. The majority of people who work at Tim Hortons. I used to work at one in a university town, so we happened to have a lot of students work there too which was all well and fine, but it was the lifers that were there that made it trashy. They'd just not show up for shifts, have 3 kids and been divorced twice at age 23, their whole family would work there, some would take a cab to work and then run out the back to dodge paying the fee, some would fight each other because one of them slept with the other's boyfriend, and they'd be high on coke while at work. Some have moved on and now sell "It Works!" Because they're all mompreneurs that have really turned their life around by making a whopping $200 annually because they don't see the company as a scam. I have no idea how they survive.A kayak on top of a hearse. Smoking while wheeling a pram.Orange spray tanBlack roots with bleached hair.Tit tattoosLook like a tweeker.An infinity sign tattoo on wrist or foot. Dirty elbows. If you can't clean an elbow... You can't clean anythingTramp stamps. Also those really oversized, gaudy hoop earrings.  if you're 16 and pregnantSome examples of bumper stickers/vinyls that make an otherwise clean ride trashy as fuck.

I see how the first one can be well-intentioned but you're not helping the reception of women in the car scene by perpetuating yourself as an anomaly. Same goes for inspirational Facebook quotes about how "Car girls aren't weird, they're a rare gift from God". No, they're a fucking common occurrence in 2016 and treating yourselves like unicorns isn't helping anybody.Painted eyebrowsTramp stampI once had a dispute with my boss over this one:

We were at a picnic at another camp and I asked why we never serve walking tacos for picnics because they are quick n easy for the kitchen staff.  He responds saying that he has always thought of them as trashy.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*I was working a construction job a while back and I was told to wait on the ground floor for someone.  I bent down to retie my boots and a pallet full of mixing cement comes crashing down where I was just standing.  I clearly remember the foreman saying I would have been "stone cold dead" if my shoes were tied.  Broad daylight, nobody reported the accident (OSHA was different back then).  If anyone has seen the movie Grand Canyon, you'll know how I felt.I was 10 or maybe 12 years old.  My mom took me to the mall so she could go to the Target.  There was a baseball card/comic book store right next to the Target and while she shopped I got to go look at the collectibles.  While I was looking at the cards in the case, a guy came in.  He looked around for a minute, then approached me and asked if I liked baseball cards.  I said that I did and he said he had a Babe Ruth card in his van and asked if I would like to see it.  We were right at the counter and the clerk was right there, but I got a real creepy vibe from this guy.  I said no and left the store to go back to Target and find my mom.  I looked behind me as I walked into Target and, sure enough, he was following me.  I was starting to get a little scared, so I turned into the women's underwear aisle, thinking he wouldn't follow me.  He kept after me until I finally found my mom.  I never told her about it because I didn't want to scare her.  At the time I thought maybe he wanted to steal my $10 but now I'm pretty sure he wanted more than $10.

TL;DR Creepster tried to get me in the mallWhen I was really young, a guy stopped me when I was leaving school and asked if I liked PlayStation and Nintendo. I told him I did, and that I really liked final fantasy and he said "what a coincidence, I have that with a TV in my van. wanna come play?" 

I told him I had to ask my mom first, and to stay here. I ran home and called my mom to ask, and she told me to lock the door, get in the basement, and don't open the door for anyone. She explained what was happening to me when she got home and once I knew, I was pretty freaked out. A client threatened my family in court. 

He had just finished nearly beating an old man to death with a 4 way so I took it pretty seriously i was in a local swimming pool and a ~~friend~~ mentioned how he thought i could fit into the storage locker. i jumped in and he locked it behind me. i learned a few things that day.

1 i can indeed fit into some storage lockers.

2 this person was not my friend.

3 strangers won't help you if your ~~friend~~ says you are fine even if you are crying for help.

4 putting the vents at the bottom of a locker is real dumb. i few years ago I was at a bowling center on a busy day. When we were about to leave we heard a big bang. 

A man had thrown the heaviest bowling ball on a woman's head. Later I read that he did it on purpose and the women had severe brain damage. And was lucky to be alive. The man got sentenced to 18 months in prison.


edit: someone noted to me that I forgot  forced psychological evaluation and the 7.5k reimbursement he had to payMany years ago, I was just about to walk into the restaurant where I was the assistant manager, when I was approached by this huge guy who was all smiles and generally gave across this body language of being friendly, is a  "sorry but I need to ask you something" kinda way. Next thing I knew, he was screaming at me about some friend I hadn't seen in a while. Turns out my friend had stolen some weed off this dodgy guy, and my name had come up for some reason. Right there in the middle of a busy road in a busy city, he pulled out a Stanley Knife and told me he was going to cut my throat with it if I didn't give him his 350 right there. I still don't remember exactly what I said to him but he left, told me he was going to kill me if he ever saw me again and I went into work. An addict wanted money from me down town, but I literally had nothing but my clothes on me. So I said sorry man, all out. 

Dude lumbers towards me slowly, pushes me over, and stab me in the thigh with a Swiss Army knife. 

I booked it to the hospital for stitches. Didn't hurt until I actually looked at it. Adrenaline didn't stop pumping for a very long time. 

Edit: Lot of people asking "why didn't you run if he was lumbering towards you?"

A: I was 13, he was a full grown adult, I had a bad haircut, he pulled a knife on me, I froze in fear.I guess this qualifies... thunderstorm downdraft on a fully laden plane. Your seatbelt is done up, but there's fresh air between your butt & the seat as the plane drops. When I was twelve years old I was beaten up in a crowded bus station at rush hour by a boy several years older than me for absolutely no reason whatsoever. It was a completely unprovoked attack and I was trapped against a one-way door. The adults standing around waiting for their buses to go home from work did absolutely nothing to help me or to stop me from being attacked.Fistula rupture of a patient in my hospital.  Blood everywhere.  Blood on the floor, ceiling, workers, and everywhere else you can imagine.  Splurging everywhere.  Doctors and nurses worked on her for 45 minutes, but nothing they could do to save her.  It looked like someone had been slashed open with a sword in the room, and the worst part is that her 3 kids were there to see it.  It was well lit and populated as it was my workplace, i was a pourer in a foundry at the time. Due to a mistake in the metal, it had to be put back into the furnace instead of being poured, a job that is done by using a crane to take the ladle (big bucket full of molten metal) back to the furnace. The ladle is then manually rolled over and the metal poured back into the furnace.

I was the lucky guy to roll it in, and whilst rolling it the crane driver made a mistake and moved the ladle out of position. This resulted in a wave of 1600C (~3000f) metal flying toward me like water off a spoon in the sink. Due to the light coming from the molten metal I couldn't guage the depth of the wave at the time, but looked down to see nothing but orange light surrounding me from the waist up. This lasted a moment at most, but in that moment every possible injury that could come from that crossed my mind. 

No injury came of that, like a spoon in the sink the wave was very thin and my gear was good enough. But I was genuinely terrified then. 

[EDIT]
There's a few people having difficulty picturing this, the wave of metal that hit me was splash back off the top rim of the furnace. I was on a stand, about half of my body was above the rim of the furnace. When rolling the metal in, it comes out of the top of the bucket, and the crane operator managed to clip the furnace ventilation. This turned the ladle and caused it to go everywhere. What hit me was more like a sheet of metal that happened to be molten. Seeing it hit me, I was unable to tell how deep the actual wave was so from my perspective, I had a sheet of molten metal around my waist that was unknown depth and incredibly hot. As I was the one turning the ladle in, I flicked down the lock on the turning wheel and quickly turned to jump down from the stand. This all happened very quickly. There was a distinct line and some metal splash on the front of my jacket where the wave had come into contact with me. Once I determined I was OK, I put the gear back on and finished the roll over. I'm not sure it was the most terrifying thing that happened to me, but it was the most terrifying thing that happened to me at that point in my life. 

I was about 11, in Cape Town - South Africa, visiting family. 

My parents were walking in front of me, and I was walking with my little cousin directly behind them. We were in a shopping mall (Tyger Valley Center for any South Africans out there).

Anyway, I think my parents had stopped to get some money out of an ATM, and my and my cousin were just being silly, as you do at that age. 

This guy, maybe in his mid-20s sat across from us on a bench, pointed at us, then my parents, and then dragged his finger along his neck. He then pulled open his jacket, and pulled a gun out of a pocket. 

I don't know if that was a real gun, and I didn't care to find out. I told my parents immediately, and we kind of circulated the security personnel before eventually leaving. 

Was a bit of an uncomfortable situation.Was taking my kids for a walk in the park near our apartment once when a guy and a woman came out of the tree line suddenly and the guy said to give him my wallet and anything else in my pockets.  He had some weird screwdriver / knife thing and I pushed my daughter, my eldest child, behind me.  I was going to do the same for my son but the woman grabbed his other arm for some reason and my heart felt like it was going to explode for some reason, I suddenly forgot about self preservation and jumped forwards and broke the woman's nose.  I felt a sharp pain under my ribs and looked to see that the man had just shanked me, but at this point two other guys who had been jogging were running up and shouting.  

The police that patrolled the park showed up not long after that.   I was sitting and trying not to bleed to death, the man had ran off and his screwdriver was still in me.  The woman was on the ground crying and shouting because I had also knocked the top front of her teeth loose / out.   The two joggers were originally asking the woman if I was the assaulter but the situation cleared up soon.  I got taken to the hospital and questioned about the incident, there was a while when it looked like I was going to be charged with battery for the woman since it turns out she actually had a decently well off family, was just an addict.   They tried to sue me but it was thrown out and she was sentenced for attempted kidnapping.  

I had a tube in my chest for two weeks after my surgery to remove the shank, but it all cleared up after that.   Just glad my kids are safe.  

**EDIT**: I am male.  Sorry for not clarifying.  The mother of my children passed away several years ago. http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/03/nyregion/officer-is-shot-lining-up-3-suspect-slain.html

In the second grade, around 7-8 years old, babysitter picked me up from a church ( I went to a catholic elementary school and was practicing to make my communion that sunday, I think this was a tuesday or thursday), and we were walking down the sidewalk when I saw a man breakdancing on the street (Circa 1992 in Queens, New York at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church/School) and thought cool...
but at the same moment, my babysitter was pushing me against a metal fence alongside the sidewalk. 

I didn't hear anything but what I was witnessing was a NYPD (police officer) being shot multiple times by two criminals who had stolen a womans purse several blocks away (how stereotypical). One criminal was on one side, the officer in the middle, and the other criminal on the other side, so who knows who shot who, but the officer was shot many times (over 5), one criminal was shot in the head and died on the spot, the other criminal got away but was caught nearby.
Fucking hectic, I believe my mother saved the newspaper the next day, and I remember watching the news that night. Astoria circa 1991-1992. If anyone could find more info, it would be like tying up some loose ends in my life as it's been something I've thought about many many many times before.

EDIT: HOLY SHIT, I've googled this many times in the past couple of years and never found anything and in 2 seconds of searching I found the article. As you can read in the article, it seems my memory serves me slightly incorrect...
I was 18 or 19 and picking up a prescription at the pharmacy. While I was waiting in line, a man (who I guess was waiting in line as well) started taking pictures of my feet with his cell phone. He wasn't even trying to be subtle, just kind of bent over and aimed his phone at my feet. I moved a few feet away and he just followed me. The pharmacist saw the whole thing and mouthed "do you know him?" I shook my head with my eyes wide, grabbed my prescription and bolted away from the counter. I hid in the store until I saw him leave and drive off because I was afraid he might follow me.

Maybe not terrifying, but definitely unnerving and creepy. Still creeps me out thinking about it.  [removed]I was followed. It wasn't super populated where he saw me, but it was midday (the edges of the city centre), and we definitely weren't the only people around. This guy started talking to me and getting too close, telling me that I was very beautiful and asking how old I was (a very young looking 18 - I told him I was 16, I think, in the hope that he would think that was creepy and go away. This guy was nearly middle aged). It was just kind of usual-creepy to start with, until it became obvious that he was following me beyond the point of just being a weird guy making conversation with a passerby. I told him I had to go, and flat out walked into traffic to get away from him, and he literally yelled "I'm following you!" after me, and ran up to me once the cars had passed.

Eventually I caught up with a bigger crowd of people, refusing to speak to him anymore. He was stupid enough to try and take hold of me. I yelled, and people turned around, so he ended up running away.

I also had someone yell "I hope you get raped" at me and my friends in London, and nobody turned around there. Londoners see more shit, I imagine. My dog and I are stopped at a crosswalk and he barks and scares this woman. As soon as he barked the walk dude came up to cross but the lady started yelling about my needing to control my dog and she pulled out a taser. I'm just trying to get across the street and she starts making even a bigger scene saying how she's going to shock me. My dog is barking at the crazy lady we are standing in the street now, at a busy intersection and I thought to my self I'm about to get tased in front of all these people. A couple of years ago I was jogging in the centre of my town as usual, when I realized I was being followed by some guy I had never seen. 

He kept trying to talk to me, and at some point he grabbed me from behind and went full molester on me. I shook free then started screaming, knocking on the hood of a car passing by. He ran away, never to be found. 

I couldn't jog for over a year.

Edit to add: obligatory rip my inbox, also thanks for the encouraging replies (I resumed jogging after a year or so by the way). 

Would also like to remind everyone in a situation of possibile assault to run away, make a lot of noise, run towards houses/people/cars so you can get someone's attention and be helped. Scream "fire!" if need be, people may ignore calls for help but usually respond in case of fire. And, lastly, report the incident to the authorities.It wasnt me, but when I was still a college student, I witnessed first hand the bystander effect.

A friend and I had just ridden our wave boards like nerds from the engineering dorm down into the public square (Red Square at UW, we rode down nonstop from McCarty hall) and were sitting on the library steps watching the sunset. Across the way near the smoke stacks, we saw a couple yelling at one another really exaggeratedly. The guy then grabbed the girl and started hauling her about. We were amused, as we thought they were just play fighting  there was a large group of students sitting right next to them watching and doing nothing either. Nothing seemed wrong until he threw her to the ground, and started dragging her towards the stairwell leading to the parking garage.

During this time, a group of five girls left the garage and walked past. The girl, still being forcibly dragged, pleaded to them, Please help me!  we could hear her clearly from across the square. The girls looked and did nothing, and kept walking. Nobody on the stairs moved, either. They just watched. My friend and I got up and started walking quickly towards them, but they disappeared into the stairwell before we got halfway across. There, we intercepted the girls who had passed them.

Did you see that? they were asking amongst themselves, worriedly. I glared at them for not stopping.

I sent my friend into Odegaard library to have the help desk call the campus police. While he did that I went into the stairwell and headed down the steps, all the while hearing the girl screaming while the guy kept hitting her and shouting at her.

I got to the bottom platform, passing two people on their way up. One was joking about how it looked like the guy was going to kill his girlfriend. They were amused and unconcerned, and ignored me.

The bottom platform has double-swinging doors that lead to a smaller room with an elevator, and then more doors leading directly into the garage. The guy and girl were in this room, and I was in the stairwell just outside. I waited there for campus police while the guy kept yelling and the girl kept crying. After about thirty seconds, he hit her again, and hefted my wave board, kicked the door open and shouted (rather lamely) STOP IT OR ILL HIT YOU!

The girl took this opportunity to break free and run up the stairs. The guy (taller and more muscular than me, whoops) looked surprised as well but didnt move, he saw my club-like board and gave up immediately. He tried to explain that his girlfriend was threatening to have him deported (he was in the US illegally past his visa or something) and he was trying to blackmail him or something of the sort. I held him there for a few minutes waiting for campus police, but they still didnt show up. I finally told him to get on the elevator and to stay away from the girl, and that Id beat the shit out of him if I saw him doing that again. He scrammed.

Went outside and saw my friend waiting. He said the front desk at the library wasnt willing to call the campus police, and when he finally relented and called, they said they would send a unit out. We waited about an hour and nobody showed up.


Edit: This isn't the exact video that I had seen in college, but it's a great indication of showing that in a group setting, even if one person is aware of something is wrong, if nobody else is reacting, they're less likely to act out. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE5YwN4NW5o)Walking back from lunch to my office. I work in a urban area but it usually is safe to walk. From the corner of my eye I thought I saw someone following me. Didn't think too much about it but picked up my pace a little. I had to stop at the crosswalk and the person behind me catches up and I feel something on my back and he tells me to make a left turn. I turn into the next street and he asks me for all the money in my wallet. I gave it to him and he bolted past me. It had to be no later than 1:00 PM and I got mugged right in broad daylight.  Almost drowned as a 6 year old in a populated adult pool. I was floundering for what felt like a minute, quickly loosing breath and swallowing water. No around me heard my gargled cries. No one helped. Thank god my mother pulled me out before it was too late.

And that's how i developed my fear of water.I'm a 20-something lady. I was heading home from the gym (tired) dressed elegantly (on my way from work) along a large, well-lit street. About a block from my house, a man first tried to catch my attention and then to grab me and pull towards the bushes on one side of the sidewalk, having already partly removed his pants.

I screamed bloody murder and ran home. After calling the police and describing the attacker, they asked what I was wearing. I was going to get mad, but it turned out he matched the description of a local pedophile suspect that preys on young girls form the nearby school. I was wearing a rather girly navy blue skirt with a white shirt that day. 

He was never arrested.Sixteen, female fresh out from school for the day. Take bus home and am standing next to a kid who felt like wearing all red. Car pulls up and a guy in the backseat has a handgun. Points it at the kid in the red but I knew more or less everyone at the bus stop was going to get shot because some dumbass wanted to wear gang-affliated colors. Light turns green and the driver goes and I'm left reeling with the whole "what if" scenarios for a few days.When I was 3, someone tried to kidnap me from a shopping centre. I had been standing next to my mum when some random guy grabbed me by the wrist and started making a fast move to the exit. Even nearly 30 years later I can still remember this vividly, from what he looked like to being too scared to say anything as I was being led out whilst frantically trying to look for my mum. Luckily enough mum had spotted me and screamed as we we're next to the exit and he let me go and ran out. I had nightmares about the man with the yucky eyes for years after this.I've had a drunk guy threaten to stab me over "40p for the bus bruv" at 3pm on a Wednesday in the busy town centre.

I live in a classy place... I didn't give him the 40p fyiAs a young teenager, in the early 90s I went to a slightly low-rent amusement park on a school trip. They had some rides, nothing like the huge ones at premium parks, but there was a reasonable looking rollercoaster - with a full loop and a corkscrew-style part (I'm sure there's a bunch of terminology I don't know about rides, so don't mind me).

My group of friends all decided to give it a try. I'd never been on one, so while I was a bit scared, it looked pretty cool, so why not? Our group all get on at the same time, talking and bullshitting each other in the way excited kids do.

The cars start moving backwards up a slope. Once it gets to near the top, the cars would release and go down the track. We're still moving up the slope and I look across at my friend and his restraint is down. Mine isn't. Oh shit.

I panic naturally. We must be over a hundred feet up, on a 45' slope. There's nothing I can do to get off and it can't be too long until the cars will drop. I grab my restraint and pull it down across my chest. I *think* it locks into place, but now the cars drop.

I can't do a fucking thing except hold on. The speed pins me into my seat, and while I don't think I'd come out in the corkscrew part, here comes the loop. As I pass the top of the loop I feel the cars slow just a little. My knuckles must have been transparent, they were gripping the edge of my seat so hard in a vain attempt to hold my upside-down ass in the seat...

We exit the loop and go up another slope to then reverse the track direction. As it slows I can just about prise my hands from the seat to check my restraint and it felt secure. Naturally I didn't quite trust it and I gripped my seat all the way back through the course.

I got off the ride in a daze and never said a thing about it.


- Looking back I didn't know shit about rollercoasters, I think I assumed restraints would come down and lock in automatically. There was a ride operator (a bored, tired kid not much older than I was) who probably  should have walked down the cars before they left, to check stupid kids like me were locked in, and just missed me.As I (F, about 30 at the time) was walking home from work along West Broadway (in lower Manhattan) a man grabbed me. I was on my last nerve that day so instead of being scared or submitting I went full Rambo on him, yelling and smacking him with my purse. I was taking no shit from anyone that day, and he turned and ran.Recently went to Dolphin Cove to take care of my number one bucket list item, swim with sharks. I went with my best friend. Her and I are in our 40's and cute enough in our own right. Our shark trainer flirted with us but we thought nothing of it. Once we were in the water, we had to sit on a bench. He maneuvered the shark on our lap. Part of the program was the trainer guiding our hands to feel the shark. He put both of our hands on his very erect penis. We again kind of blew it off thinking it was an accident. Then he told us to spread our legs so we could hold and balance the shark on our legs. He slid his hand up our thighs and got his fingers under both of our bottoms before we stopped him. We both felt violated and it ruined my very top bucket list item experience for me. It horrifies and frightens me to think of how often he's done that with other women and kids. Junior high, first year. 85 Ib loner book gal. Get followed by much larger (150Ib+) boy, boy kicks legs out from under me, I pick up books walk on, boy shoves me face forward, I get to my feet and continue. Boy is enraged by my lack of resistance. Punches me between back of head and neck. Everything flies, saw neat colors. Stumble and struggle to pick up papers, books etc. There were at least fifteen or twenty kids watching this unfold, no one helped. No one said a word. I was lucky that I wasn't knocked out or hurt worse. But I lost a lot of faith in humanity that day. Now? Still lose hope in people, but work as tech in ER and there's always, AT LEAST one thing that makes your heart melt and feel like life's more than worth it, everyone's lives are worth it. Trouble is you can't be scared to intervene when needed. In rio I was robbed at ..gun.. point on a crowded street in broad daylight. The guy just put the gun to my back and walked with me and said,"give me your money or your life." My heart hasn't ever beat faster..

Edit: God damnit.. I definitely was not robbed at fun point.. 

Also for those curious, I gave up my money without a fuss. Beforehand you may think you'll do something different but when you are there in the moment you don't have time to think through each scenario. Is your life worth risking 10 bucks over? Nah.. However, I was robbed again by the same guys 2 more times with a knife and then a gun again. On the third time I just yelled kinda pissed threw the money on the ground and kept walking, they didn't get my cell phone at least. Told the cops and they did nothing each time. We eventually stopped seeing them (we being exchange students and me who all got robbed by them on multiple occasions) around but idk why. I was studying abroad (on year two in Brazil) so I fit in fairly well and spoke the language but I guess I didn't fit in well enough.

For those going to rio for the Olympics, look up safety tips online. It isn't just a "be smart about it" scenario. Guys should watch their drinks be made as well (good night Cinderella druggings) and people should watch for credit card cloning, and be careful about when you withdraw money and who's watching outside the bank etc.

When I was little, I used to play "the hi game," where you would wave to strangers as you drove by. When with a group of friends, you'd try to get the most people to wave hi back to you.

One time, my mom stopped to buy some flowers, and had left my friends and I in the car. For some reason one of my friends decided to keep playing the game while we were parked (which is obviously against the rules, but this isn't the time for technicalities). So she waves to this dude and he comes over, and the very first thing he says is

"So, uh... Where's your mom?"

To me as a kid, something about the way he said it was terrifying. We all thought we were done. Turns out he was just concerned, and somehow ended up tracking my mom down. But those few moments immediately after he said that were terrifying.I was a Senior in High School and was dropping my girlfriend off at her house. She lived in a pretty ghetto area, and I was from the "nice" part of town. As I was saying bye to her, her neighbor from across the street walked over to us and started yelling at me. This guy was our age and I guess she knew him as well. He started yelling at me for some reason, so I started walking towards him to do who knows what, when he said "I have a gun and I'm gonna fucking kill you". At this I just stop in my tracks trying to determine if he's being serious. And then my girlfriend stalks past me, walks up to him and slaps him in the face as hard as she can and yells "get the fuck out of here Junior and go home!". I stood there thinking "Holy shit, she just owned that guy". That was 15 years ago and we're now expecting our third kid :)Im a little late to this party but here goes. I was on a 300 mile ride on my motorcycle when I stopped for gas at a sketchy gas station. While I'm stopped this homeless guy in a puffy ratty fur jacket and a flava flav style Viking hat rides up on his bicycle with a milk crate for a basket and a home made trailer. He rings the bell on his handle bar and tells me I have a nice bike as I'm walking in to pay. I say "thanks you too bud" and he charges at me on foot and pushes me, from behind, hard and says "no man I said you have a niiiiiiiiceeeeeeee biiiiiiiiiikkkeee". Im freakin out now cuz this dude looks high as hell on something hard and, though I'm not a small dude, I've heard drugs make ya fight hella crazy. So I push this guy to the ground and yell for him to BTFU and he gets up, adjusts his hat and says "this is what you wear when you wanna sing immigrant song by Led Zepplin..... AHHHHHHH-AHH-AHHHHHHHHHHHH-AHHHHHHH!!!!!" then he runs to his bike like a mad man and rides off. Most terrifying and hilarious thing to every happen to me


Tldr; cranked out homeless dude attacked me in a parking lot. May have been Robert PlantThe hospital. Called 911 because my mom had a seizure. At hospital in the ridiculous bright light and the dr comes in and says they found a brain tumor. Texted my sister immediately and then moments later I could hear her sobbing in the waiting area from a where I was. 
The beginning of the end. When I was in 5th grade, I had a seizure in the middle of class. When I woke up on the floor, kids were running around me and laughing, and the teacher was yelling at me to get back in my desk and stop trying to get attention. Everything hurt and I was completely out of it for the rest of the day, and I didn't understand anything about what happened, or just how big of a shitlord the teacher was, until a couple of years later.Was in Chicago last year for a conference and brought my friend who was slightly terrified of urban areas (Keep in mind, we are from rural Iowa.)
      
Had to use the subway to get to the conference when suddenly a fight broke out in the car infront of us. They moved the fight throughout most of the train and started to flash guns at one point in our car. 
      
Luckily for us, a brave young fellow helped break it up and no one was seriously injured, but my friend legitimately thought there was about to be a shooting.Happened yesterday. I wasn't particularly "terrified" but a bit uneasy. 

I go grocery shopping at the same store at the same time maybe twice a week. There works a grocery bagger and once before has he waited by my car to help me put groceries in my trunk. It threw me off and made me uncomfortable (I get anxiety in social situations) but figured he was just being polite and doing his job.

I'm a really shy person and my instinct is to be polite no matter how uncomfortable I am. Plus, and I don't mean this a rude way, from our first encounter I get the sense that he's not "all there" in the head. 

So yesterday I went straight from the store to my car, opened the trunk and promptly started putting groceries in. Out of nowhere this guy appears, and we engage in polite chit chat. He asks how I am doing and I reply but make mistake of asking how he is. There he goes off on a rant of how this whole year has been awful, how he dreams of killing this dog (not sure if it was his dog or another, he lost me in the rant) and also how watching people hang is entertaining. He's getting pretty passionate in this rant and is escalates to how it's hypocritical of how the justice system treats murderers and rapists and how it's allowed for Americans to do so in other countries when fighting a war. 

Note (so that it's relevant to question) that it's broad daylight and there are several people in the parking lot. 

I'm an idiot, so I'm just standing there politely and unfortunately he's standing near the driver's side of the car. Eventually after a near 15 minute rant of murder, hanging and chopping heads I wiggle past him and tell him to take it easy. I'll probably just find another supermarket.


**EDIT** Reading all of these comments, I think I am going to call the store directly and report to the manager what he said to me. I'm not sure if this warrants a police report or not.


**EDIT 2** I called the store after work today. I let the store manager know exactly what he said to me, that it made me uncomfortable and I don't believe I'll be returning anytime soon, if at all. Without mentioning his name because I didn't know it, the manager seemed aware of who I was talking about. She says he lives with his grandmother due to his disability (did not elaborate) who she knew personally. She also stated he did not have a pet dog (after I expressed concern that he could potentially harm an innocent animal) and she would speak to the grandmother about him. Manager also stated there have been no other complaints before about him and he worked there for a while. TBH it seems like she was sort of brushing the whole situation aside, because she asked me if I told him that he was making me uncomfortable. Now, this may just be MY opinion but anytime a stranger in close proximity of me talks about justifying murder and rape makes me a wee bit uncomfortable. I don't know, maybe I'm too sensitive. However, she wrapped up the call saying she was sorry about this experience and "the situation would be handled accordingly".
A guy tried to drag me to his room when I was sick and confused at a con. Pulled me right through the lobby.

The only reason I didn't end up in his room is because I couldn't think of how to get away, so I just sat right down in the middle of the lobby and he couldn't pick me back up again.
No one helped.

My friends came back from pulling the car around and found me sitting there. Thankfully they helped me into the car and that was that. On the third of this month, in a very well lit hospital room, my Hospitalist came to my bedside after 9 days in the hospital to tell me a blood smear and flow cytometry pointed to me having a T-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma. That I needed a bone marrow biopsy to confirm. The Oncologist came to visit my room to tell me my spleen was also enlarged and in her best opinion I had likely a stage 4 (if the bone marrow came back as she thought it would) t-cell lymphoma. That I would start chemo the day after the results came back. That it would be 2 rounds of that therapy, and if I did not respond they would get ready for bone marrow transplant. Asked me if I had siblings. She said the type she thinks I have is very aggressive. As it did not show in my lymphnodes but was already showing symptoms in my spleen and liver. Apparently this is very bad.



I have three children. 11,9 and 7. I love them dearly and could not stop thinking of them. It put so many things into perspective for me. I cried. My family cried. I became extremely negative. 


The day of the 9th, the oncologist came into my room. They had some bone marrow results. It all came out quickly. She was now saying the cells looked to be reactive to an atypical infection and the pathologist saw no clonal cells. She said there was still a PCR pending that would rule out up to 99% that I was safe but sent me home. Im now waiting for my appointment tuesday for the all clear. Im very very fatigued. I contracted c-diff while in due to heavy antibiotic use. Im very very very tired. My anxiety is through the roof every second. I cant stop researching cancer. Im scared to live. Im just so scared.I accompanied my dad to the hospital while he was undergoing a routine procedure. They put him under for an hour to do a laryngoscopy. I kicked back in the cheery, well-lit lobby with my tablet, playing a game. 

I was engrossed in the game, but about ten minutes later I realized the place had gone eerily silent. I looked up and there were no nurses or staff anywhere. I was the only person in what had been a room with a half-dozen people going back and forth. Looking around, I suddenly noticed a red light flashing over one of the doors. 

My heart dropped out of my chest. My hands went icy and numb. I started counting the doors. The red light was flashing over my dad's door. I walked slowly down the hallway, trying not to make a sound. I didn't want to disturb anyone. I didn't want to miss any sounds. I didn't want to know what was happening in the room I was walking toward. I felt like a scared seven-year-old. 

A nurse came out and he grabbed me on the shoulder. "Hey," he said casually, "we're working with your dad right now but I need to have you wait in the lobby right now, okay?" 

"Okay. What's going on?" My voice was small and timid and high and I hated hearing it, hated feeling helpless. 

"Oh, we'll be out to talk to you in just a second. Sorry, but I gotta go." He slipped back into the room and the unearthly silence came back. So, I walked back to the lobby and sat down. 

A chaplain came by a bit later, as I was sitting motionless. My dad had a heart attack while under. He went into a coma, but they got his heart beating again. As I went in to see him, nurses and doctors filtered out of the room. Blood spatters on the sheets and floor. My dad quiet, wired into a half-dozen machines. About 15 minutes later, when my mom arrived to answer my urgent texts and calls, the lobby had a couple of families in there chatting happily, and the staff was back to its business. We pulled his life support four days later, after learning he was irrevocably brain-dead.

The world can change so fast. Your life can get turned upside-down. Your life can end. And for the people around you, it can just be another day. They go on without even noticing the pain inside you. That was the moment in my life this truth was most starkly plain. Nothing has ever been more terrifying.I use to take those classes at a Catholic church in the evening. I was put ahead into an older kid class (I believe I was 8, and most of them were pre teens or early teens). This one guy (14 or 15) kept offering me money for a blowjob, which at the time I had no idea what it was. A bunch of the other girls would always swarm me when he was nearby and tell me to ignore him, not take the money, etc. He was known as a trouble maker.

I asked my parents what a blowjob was, so they found out, and made a complaint. His family gave a lot of money to that church so nothing happened to him.

Then I got to church early and was just roaming around. He was there and got physical with me. I didn't really understand at the time, but now I realize he was likely trying to rape me. I called out for others to help but absolutely no one did. A few adults would stop and watch, but then they'd keep walking. Thankfully my older sister ran into us and put a stop to everything so ultimately nothing happened. He got kicked out after that.

I understand not getting involved, but no one even called the cops.Got jumped, put in a headlock while groups of people looked on while I was screaming help(I was 13), and while this was going on a crack head picked up my bike and took off with it. All on my city's public square(literally the center on town). Now I carry a knife where ever I go. Got the bike back though! 

Edit: it was mid day btw


EDIT #2: 

So many of you have said that I shouldn't carry a knife. Well the problem with that is if I don't, I'm probably dead. That's sad to say but its how this area is. Most people wouldn't think a city in NorthEast Pennsylvania would be bad... But my city came in at #4 for the most homicides per capita in america 2 years back. I've had friends that have been jumped and almost killed just by a guy beating on them. I've had friends get robbed at gunpoint. I understand when people say it can be used against me and I wouldn't pull it out if someone had a gun. But its my only option. I'd carry a gun if I was old enough to get a concealed weapons permit but until then its my one line of self defense. I'd rather pull a knife and stab someone than loose my life. Its that simple.

A guy felt me up on an extremely crowded (peak hour) bus. 

I totally froze. 

Couldn't bring myself to move a muscle as his hand slid up the bare skin of my inner thigh (I was wearing a skirt). 

It was an odd experience. I never expected myself to react like that. I always imagined that if something like that happened I'd shove them off or call them out or something,

but I didn't. 

I didn't do anything. I was at a city festival. Around 10,000 people. 10 to 15 gang bangers start harassing me, thinking I'm some one else. I asked cop after cop to help me. Because they hadn't touched me yet they technically have done nothing wrong. All at once they are all on me. A large group of white supremacists came to my aid. One even stabbed a gang banger to death when he pulled a gun. I was knocked unconscious and didn't see it. But, because of my testimony about what happened before they got involved, all charges were dropped.  When I was living in Geneva, one day I got a craving for something from home. So, naturally, I went to McDonalds and got some fries / pommes frites. I'm sitting outside with my frites when I notice some chaos and cacophony coming across the bridge - looks like it's a WTO protest, complete with tractors and black bloc protesters throwing bricks and fire bombs. This is odd, Geneva is usually quiet, tidy, and calm. I get up and start walking away from the McDonald's to try to get to a different part of the city, not realizing how wild this was about to get.

As they get closer things start getting real. They smash out storefronts, light cars on fire, and the Swiss police form a police line behind me. I am now stuck between black bloc protesters and irritated police. I get up and start moving quickly down the street as both parties are closing in on me and start inhaling a mix of burning car and some sort of gas - not sure if it was tear gas or some sort of improvised smoke bomb from the protesters. People are yelling and it is loud as hell.

I round a corner and run right into about 12 Swiss police who are preparing to set up a cordon to corral the protesters into a more controllable part of the city and start asking them to please let me through. They tense up and stare at me, then one of them grabs me by the shoulder and sort of flings me behind them and then they move on. I'm in the clear and it is immediately quiet, with clean air and a free path back to a streetcar.

Was pretty scary at the time. Now, it's just interesting.When I was living in Paris, I was attacked in the Bastille metro station during the early evening, while in a group of 5-6 girls.

This guy followed us off the train and onto an escalator, and placed himself right behind my friend. She went around me farther up the escalator to get away from him. He tried to follow her. Being fluent in French, I put my arm out to block him and told him to leave her alone.

He then grabbed my arm so hard that I later had fingerprint bruises. And then he just stared at me. It was terrifying. I was telling him to get off and leave me alone, all while trying to pry his fingers off me, and there was just no emotion or reaction on his face.

Luckily then, my friend just above me turns and sees this, **and full on Falcon kicks this guy right on the chest!** He fell back a bit, but caught himself, then grabbed her by her ponytail and punched her in the face.

By this point, we're finally at the top of the escalator (yes, this all transpired in the duration of an escalator ride) and a group of men chased the guy off.

I love you Paris, but fuck did the men there harass the shit out of me.

**Edit:** I should also add, that while I was thankful that this group of men chased him off, they also then started yelling at us, saying we must have provoked him, and that we shouldn't talk to men like him, and next time just to call the police. To which I just yelled AND WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE POLICE NOW? 

Needless to say, our going out plans were thwarted and we went home. On the way home that night, I got my ass grabbed twice and one guy flashed me right outside my house. Now, that one, he got punched in the face.I was alone at the park and I was either 5 or 6 and these girls in grade 8 (there was 3 of them) started yelling at me to get off a swing I was sitting on. Apparently it was 'their swing'. I just sat there and stared at the sand cause I was terrified until one of the girls walked behind me and then violently pushed me off the swing. Then they proceeded to kick me, throw sand at me, and shove my face in the sand till I couldn't see and barely breathe. Then they took of my shoes and threw them in a tall tree. They were those Mary Jane shoes (Powerpuff girls wore them) and my mother had just bought them for me 2 days ago.
I walked home bare foot crying and not one person did anything. The park I was at was surrounded by apartment buildings. I'm sure somebody saw. I never felt so helpless in my life.One morning I was sitting in a caf,  waiting for a friend. At the table next to me, there was a Chinese exchange student, who obviously just came to the city and didn't speak our language. Some guy walked up to her, sat next to her, groped her and said very nasty sexual things. I said "Hey that's not cool, I don't think that you are welcome and this place anymore, get out of here." Then he got to me, tried to shove me and said "What do you want from me, let's get out, I will beat you up, you asshole." It got a bit louder but finally he went out.  

Thing is, the caf was half full, it was 10 AM  and no one cared what happened to that girl or me. And no one even thought of calling the police. Pretty shitty of these people.I had a friend with primary-progressive MS. He got sick early, too. Only 35. As it progressed to the point that he started relying on a cane (and some days a walker) to get around, you can imagine how he changed. I say this not as excuse for what he did, but so you can understand how anger and depression can make a person behave differently than they had before. By this time, he was not the same man I befriended. I still cared for him and wished him will, but we stopped hanging out after that because his attitude was too terrible.

One evening, we're sitting around in a bowling alley bar. My friend's girlfriend is setting up a Karaoke show, and the sun hasn't even gone down yet. It's 8:30 at night. Three guys come in and hassle her about wanting to sing *now*. She tells them it won't start for an hour. They hassle her some more, then wander off. They bowl, the place starts to gain some customers, the lights in the bar get turned on to balance out "cosmic bowling". Then these three guys wander back in at about 10. They want to sing.

They get mad when she didn't remember the songs they'd shouted at her earlier while screwing with her microphones. They get mad again when they're told they have to fill out the little slips and wait their turn like everybody else. They get mad a third time when she won't take *five dollars* to let them go next. By now, our entire group of friends were there and celebrating a birthday. (We are *not* cool.)

The guys wander away again, then almost get skipped over before showing up to do their turn half an hour later. As they pick up the mics, they shout "WE BETTER GET TWO SONGS FOR MAKING US WAIT, TOO." into them, causing feedback and a lot of angry people. She tells them "one song. Everybody gets a chance to sing." It devolves into a full blown argument between them.

My friend, who is having a walker day, gets up to go defend his girlfriend, and in the middle of the shouting, the whole room distinctly hears my friend say "And if a bunch of niggers think they can intimidate my girlfriend..." He trails off as he realizes that the entire bar, and indeed a big chunk of the bowling alley have gone silent.

These guys aren't about to (and shouldn't) take that shit, but it didn't have to go down the way it did. All of a sudden, he's trying to back away (with his walker) from these three guys who are all twice his size while he apologizes. They're screaming at him about how he's a "crippled cracker" and they're going to make sure he needs a wheelchair if he lives through this and his girlfriend can use the walker after they break her legs too. 

Too far. They didn't have to accept the apology, and if one of them had just punched him, I'd of said that's fair and he deserved it. But we couldn't let them do what they were threatening. Next thing I know, two of our friends and I have stood up and I've shouted "That's enough." Next thing I know, they're in our faces. One of my friends is just trying to negotiate our way out of it. The other is making threats. I'm just standing there trying not to lose my game face because I'm **terrified as fuck** of this 350+ pound 6'6" mountain of a person who's picked me to square up with.

I manage to duck under the punch he throws at me, and somehow end up behind him. Desperately, I somehow end up with this guy in a full nelson. Except I'm 145 pounds and 5'8". At this point, I'm this guy's new cape. He starts swinging around wildly screaming "get him off! Get him off!" The entire room has gone from fear and agression to amusement. I hear people start to laugh. One of his buddies grabs me by the back of the shirt and shoves me away. I stumble, trip over something, and break my nose on the corner of a table. I can't even claim a decently taken punch to the face.

The Mountain walks over to me. I'm now laying on the ground with blood gushing out of my face. He leans right down over me and shouts "Stay down!" Then he looks at me for a second, points a finger in my face, and says "I get it. You gotta stand up for your boy. What you really gotta do is pick better boys, or educate yours." Then the waved finger turns into an extended hand and he helps me to my feet. Bartender grabs me a rag, and we all get kicked out together.

When the cops showed up and found us all (except loudmouth) sitting outside congenially, they agreed to let us all go on our way (and drive me to the hospital), if we all agreed to drop the matter. My friend wanted charges pressed against all three and was threatening to sue the bar too. He backed down when I told him I'd break his nose to match mine if he did anything of the sort. It was the scariest moment of my entire life, and the only reason I lived was because The Mountain showed me mercy. This fucker wanted to bankrupt me in lawyer's feesafter that?

That was eleven years ago. I only saw my friend twice after that. Once at a bar, and once at his funeral. I miss the man he was before the MS. I don't miss the angry, depressed man he became.I'm in the matter of "I don't give a shit" half the time and just hold someone's hand.  Firm handshakes are bogus and any corporate that makes a fuss about my handshake probably wouldn't be hiring me for other reasons than my handshake anyways.  The worst is when they close the grip too soon and only get your fingers. I always freak out internally when that happens. I'm a big guy with small hands I can't give firm handshakes unless its with someone who is either slim or short.I volunteered at a clinic for severely developmentally disabled and brain injury patients. The patients were nonverbal, had no control over their bodily functions, were basically walking vegetables, to put it unkindly. Their teeth were usually completely covered by swollen, bleeding gums, and the teeth themselves were in the worst shape they could possibly be in....it was horrific.Dental hygienist, saw someone with needed 11 root canals.  ELEVEN.

While the dentist was trying to work on one tooth a nearby tooth just fell apart.Hygienist.....worked for a pediatric dentist who saw Medicaid children.  Welfare moms would bring their two year olds in with every single tooth decayed to the gums from candy and cola.  The parents teeth weren't any better.  My last true nightmare was years and years ago. I was 9 years old (am 33 now) and I will never forget that dream.

I had dreamt of a gymnasium full of children my age playing different games and sports. Everybody was having a great time until the gym doors opened to an army of penguins. At first, we thought oh, cute! penguins! 

But the penguins yielded axes, chainsaws, knives, etc, and they massacred everyone in the gym. So much blood and guts. I have no idea why I dreamed about that, I wasn't under any medication and I had a great childhood. It was very weird and scarred me to this day. My house was inundated by swarms of things. First it was ants, then roaches, rats, spiders, and finally giant scarab looking beetles I found a tiny turtle in my room and I decided to raise it. I put my heart and soul into giving it a perfect childhood. After a few weeks, I brought it to the jungle to let it back into the wild. Then, a giant jungle rabbit stepped on it. I woke up sweating and in tears.Personally, I would say 65+.  That's technically the age when you're considered a senior citizen Dying of old age, meaning there was no obvious disease present, I would say 90 and up.Seeing as how life expectancy is nearly 80, I'd say anything after 75 would be fair to say "old age" as the cause, though old age really isn't a cause of death, it's always something else like major organ failure. For me it's the "End Poem" from Minecraft. Specifically; "and the universe loves you". 

Going through a tough time this made me cry. It's something so relatable to everyone, gamer or not. It's a reminder that the most average joe has something to give to life, and life to them. "A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business."

A.A. MilneNot so much a quote but a fact about the human body; "Every cell and organism within your body exists to keep you well and alive, when you say you are alone that is not exactly true, though you cannot hear them or see them, every cell and every living organism in your body cares and loves you, cause without you they will die.""Just Do It""Whether you think you can or you think you can't... you're probably right."         Henry Ford
 Attitude can make or break you."Why do we kill people who kill people to prove that killing people is wrong?"  From a bumper sticker I saw when I was 10"It ain't be like it is, but it do."    Life saving quote."I'd rather betray the world than let the world betray me." - Cao Cao

A while ago a buddy of mine was trying to quit smoking so he asked me before the party to stop him if he tried to smoke. Mid party everyone is wasted and he somehow managed to get a pack of smokes.

Authentic Japanese ramen is quite delicious though.I think the ramen that comes in the packets taste good but they're so unhealthy that I just totally avoid it.

Homemade ramen made with fresh ingredients tastes much better and it can be pretty healthy depending on the recipe you use. I make it at least once a week and I love it. Authentic Japanese ramen from a restaurant is delicious, too, but I don't have many of those restaurants around me so that's more of a once in awhile treat.Legendary, a real life and time saver. Definitely not an eat everyday food though.Is it good for you? Not really. Is it convenient and tasty? Absolutely! Plus, you can do lots of things with it. My favorite is the Chili flavor from Maruchan. I've never had authentic though so that might change my opinion. instant is garbageIt makes me feel like it has the least nutrients per volume of any food. I can't even get sated on it. Just supersaturated with salt.It's shitty, but hey, in a Monday night, with almost no money and hungry, I can't be picky. It's basically Pot Noodle, isn't it? Cheap food for poor folks like students?Love authentic ramen. It's the broth that makes it fantastic. I especially love the tonkotsu variety. Shin Ramyun is the only ramen that matters.Go authentic. 

If not? Don't make/buy ramen.It's not that filling but it's only ever good if you put hot sauce on itI've requested it for dinner tonight. Throw the "flavor packet" away, add an egg or two, some fresh mushrooms, and a little splash of low sodium teriyaki sauce, and it's not terrible. I have strange tastes sometimes though.Top ramen is to me what ice cream and starbucks are for a white girl who just got dumped. It's a shitty, shitty comfort food. And it tastes so good. 

The stuff I get at japanese restaurants is good too, although it's hit or miss because they overload it with so much stuff that depending on the place, they can put in a bunch of stuff I hate.

Idk how authentic any of it is, because I'm not a weeb.I like it. I know it is cliche, but I ate a lot of ramen while in college and later in the Navy. I don't eat it much, if at all these days, but when i do I am always a comforted a bit.Never had it the authentic ramen. The packet one is... meh. If you want to sacrifice your health just to save a few bucks on your grocery bills, ramen is for you.

It's weird but I'm embarrassed about most interactions I have on social media. I think I'm to blame, because I but myself in that situation, but it's such a different feeling before and after I post. I have this internal conflict in which I want to do what I want, and it's not like I'm a huge controversial douche or anything, or not that I know of. But after I post I always feel like I'm annoying someone regardless (which I know is probably just me overreacting).. It sucks the fun out of having a small series of posts on instagram, or liking someone's photo on facebook. I wish I were less compliant in pleasing others, and convincing when I say I don't really care :pI wasn't a vegetarian for ethical reasons. I just really didn't like the texture of meat, especially hitting gristle which would trigger my gag reflex. I developed a stronger gag reflex.I want to say it was difficult to maintain the lifestyle while busy, but honestly I missed bacon cheeseburgers.Nothing in particular. I was a vegetarian for about two years. I went on a bike ride with a friend. We rode about 30 miles, which was pretty standard for us at the time. When I was headed home I felt really hungry, more hungry than I had ever felt. I went to the store and bought some chicken to make tacos. No real process behind my thinking on that purchase. I just walked by the poultry section and couldn't resist.When my mom was a vegetarian, she forgot she was a vegetarian when we went out for lunch and didn't remember until she was half done with her food.For me, there were just a lot of foods I hadn't tried and I felt like I was missing out. Most of what I tried after switching back to eating meat are now some of my favorite foods. 

Netflix exclusive is Daredevil but in general Futurama. Too bad I've watched it to death. Peaky Blinders!Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt.Currently I'm watching supernatural. Started last week. It's pretty cool. I like it because it's a series you can just watch without being emotionally disturbed after 1-2 episodes. It's just cool to watch by the side It's always sunny in PhiladelphiaMaster of None is pretty good.I love how long they've kept Scrubs on. I watch it whenever I'm multitasking. Dishes? Scrubs. Laundry? Scrubs. Hopping in bed for the night and Redditing on my phone? Scrubs.

It never gets old.Futurama of course, but I'm falling in love with F is for Family. Dexter.Futurama!Trailer Park Boys.

Worst case Ontario you give it a try and don't like it. It varies. I'm always binge watching something, but right now it is Lost Girl.I thought Bloodline was fantastic, buzzed for season 2.loved breaking bad and was actually sad when I finished it :/NarcosThe best original series (for me) are Narcos and Master of None. Daredevil is also pretty great but those two are just plain better.Jessica Jones.

A psychological Marvel thriller with Krysten Ritter and David Tennant? Oh man.Danger 5, so god damn funnyBobs BurgersSons of AnarchyIt's always sunny in Philadelphia. So dark and so funnyThe RanchI really like Orange is the New Black, but the main character does annoy me at times.

It's pretty difficult to recommend because telling people the main thrust of the story spoils the ending of the first episode.Laid and Dreamland, two Australian shows. 

Laid is a relationship show about a woman in her 20s. 
Dreamland is a workplace comedy. W/ Bob & DavidGrace and Frankie. Parks and Recreation. I just love the distinct personality of each character. Longmire. It's a (sometimes) procedural cop show in a Wyoming county. But there's a story arc that really makes it intriguing. Think "The Rifleman" meets Columbo.

I can't think recent cop shows to pair with The Rifleman. But Longmire is done well. Lou Diamond Phillips and Katie Sackoff are great in this.The killing, wonderfully fucked up for a cop show. Blows C.I.S. out of the water although the first season is the best made me ball my eyes out at the end.

Tons of action too and enough characters for everyone to find a favorite. Its an absolutely amazing show!My partner. Mostly because I wouldn't be able to live without her if anything happened to her.

Other people liked me. Then, I thought about how I talk about myself. Anytime I made a mistake I would berate myself. I would call myself an idiot and stupid. I noticed I said negative stuff about myself all the time.

So, when I noticed myself having a bad thought about myself, I would defend myself. One mistake doesn't make me stupid. It was tough to catch these bad thoughts at first as they were so automatic, but I eventually learned to recognize them.

Having used a drug and possessing it are different things.Cause the internet lies.i enjoy drugs. why does that mean i should get arrested? It is the internet.  A lot are simply pretending.Exactly how are you going to trace them?  Not much non-repudiation in a Reddit account. r/nostupidquestionsI thought it was a no face no case type of thing Because no one actually gives a fuck. You can have drugs in your system you just can't possess, sell, grow, process, transport or operate a vehicle, boat, plane etc. or "hold them for a friend" and expect to get away with it every time.  Although every subreddit is infiltrated with undercover operatives who are focused on this sort of thing 24/7,  it's probably because drug enforcement officers aren't able to squeeze into the tubes of the Internets, and pop out of the poster's computer in their Mum's basement, to arrest them.



/sPolice don't have a duty to prosecute every crime or suspected crime. They are supposed to prioritize and only prosecute when something is in the public interest. It would be a huge waste of resources to track someone down from reddit and arrest them when the redditor could just say "Oh that thing I posted on reddit? I was only joking."Bust his ass officer!!Thanks for the answers/laughs... lolCuz I live in Washington duh! proxiesAnonymity and the police don't care about what happens online.Well because my dog is exactly like my wife.Dogs became what they are today due to selective breeding. Starting from a wild canine, the less aggressive, more submissive, more human-dependent, most useful for the job, were selected. We programmed dogs to be how they are.

Some say that led to animals that are mentally akin to juvenile wolves; they never grow up.

http://www.wired.com/2011/06/dog-bark-origins/

That also makes them continue the playful behavior of pups. Wolf pups need to play to train for fighting, hunting, and killing. This is an evolutionary survival advantage, so it's a hardwired instinct for pups. Being retarded development wolves, dogs retain this instinct until adulthood. That instinctive behavior drives them to like this kind of simulation. Chasing a stick (or a ball, or a puppet) thrown by a human both fulfills this hunting/killing play need, and also fulfills their irresistible need to bond with and please their masters (a pack leader/fatherly figure, and also a selective breeding reinforced behavior).Chewing on sticks maybe cleans worse things out of their teeth.  Could also have been bred into them by humans, whether just making them more adorable or actually used as functional fetching of small spears or kindling.  
  
My guess is it's probably just that they have evolved an affinity for it from being around humans who had lots of sticks for fires and tools.  Being attracted to sticks keeps them around humans, which keeps them well fed.Probably for the same reason they like squeaky toys; they remind them of bones cracking in between their teeth, like how squeaky toys remind them of the dying noises a prey animal makes.   

Animals are fucking savage. The same reason that they lick themselves, stimulation.Maybe it's from before days of domestication?  Maybe it feels like a bone from a hunting kill that they can take back to the clan master.


I dunno, I just woke up so my brain isn't functioning properly yet.Dogs kind of like everything Because they don't care about material things like humans do. They have happiness down far better than we ever will, all they need is love and a stickInteresting question, but it belongs more to r/shittyaskscienceIt's not that the dog likes the stick so much as it is the stick....... He was an asshole. A complete bastard. And because of that, we had a common enemy, that demanded a higher standard that what we had ever been held to. He forced us to learn, and be better than what we were before.

He wrote back "Trying too. Why you laughing?". I said "well, I congratulate you for becoming a dad and all the guys assumed it's your birthday". To which he replied "it IS my birthday". 
 
hahaha, I had no clue. What are the odds of that.I've been working at the same place for 6 months now. I'm always pretty worried that everyone's annoyed at me or that I'm messing up too much (I'm a bit paranoid) but one of the girls told me that I've become one of those reliable waitresses that you see on the rota and think "oh good, Jen's in". It's a seemingly small thing to say but it boosted my confidence so much.Last night I got freaked out by a spider that was on my shoulder and flicked it off. Then I noticed it was walking funny because it only had 4 legs. The thought crossed my mind to put him out of his misery, but I saw how he was still fighting to survive. Who am I to decide he can't make it with 4 legs? Just as I convinced myself he could beat the odds and go on to live a meaningful life he proceeds to walk off the edge of the counter and leaps to his death.. he didn't die from the fall but just as he landed my dog walked in and casually stomped the remaining life out of mister spider. I will never forget the way my dog was wagging his tail, oblivious to the fact that he was now a cute cold blooded murderer.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*When I was a teenager, I worked at McDonalds. One night, some degenerate decided to smear their shit all over the stalls, toilets, walls, and sinks in the bathroom. My boss told me to clean it up. I told him I would not. He said it was my job. I told him it wasn't my job anymore. Was told upon hire that I would get rotating Saturdays off. Never saw a single Saturday off. 

They asked if I knew someone looking for a job. They interviewed my son-in-law and hired him on the spot. He told them he had to give his current job a 2 week notice. After the 2 weeks my SIL showed up to work and they said they had forgot to tell him they gave his job to someone else.

Someone pissed in my drink.

50 hours a week on my feet without a break or lunch.

And lots of other stuff. The straw that broke the camels back was when a costumer gave me a 10 buck tip (In front of my boss) and my boss accused me of stealing. Told him to fuck off. Currently unemployed but that was the most miserable 8 months of my life and I don't regret it (yet).My boss was a lazy piece of shit. I essentially took over her job out of necessity. She came in only occasionally. 

The last straw was when she told me to call a client who had a scheduled euthanasia for their dog to ask them to come in 4 hours early so we could close early. 

What? Fuck. No. Just, no. If it's that important to you, YOU call them.  
I had a boss once told me it was OK to go and visit my father while he was dying of cancer is long as it didn't affect my job. I took a deep breath and told him to go fuck himself and walked out and got a new job that dayI left work each day struggling to breathe, and after the weekend I felt soo much better. Turns out the lack of ventilation in my toxic chemical heavy job gave me an abdomen full of tumors.

It was more complex than that, but that's what it boiled down to. I didnt know it was cancer until like 9 months later thanks to my crappy doctor twice telling me it was nothing but an infection. Caught it rather late, spread all over.

Then they refused to pay me what they owed me! They refused to honor the under-the-table overtime I put in. I had to fight them for it. They submitted fake time sheets and really tried hard to screw me. It was a couple of years before I saw that money. That really hurt, I had to sell everything I owned.

I wanted to quit earlier, tried to but they kept talking me into staying, since they were short handed. They kept promising theyd install proper ventilation, never did.[deleted]I worked in retail during and for a few hours after university. Worked for a shitty suit store and got a management position. For six months I worked for 60-80 hours as week, had no training, very little staff and an upper management team that was a gong show.  I was on salary so I didn't get paid past 40 hours. 

I was trying to turn the store around, and was hitting our targets despite all the challenges. Came down with severe bronchitis and eventually had to take 2 days off to recover. 

Returned to find that our VP had come in while I was gone and left new sales targets that were impossible to hit and drafted a list of minor problems with the store.

I was furious, grabbed a scrap of paper and quit over fax. I gave them 48 hours notice and they were shitting their pants trying to find a replacement. 

Very satisfying. Got hired for a 4 day work week, guaranteed a minimum of 32 hours a week.  Spent a few months at 32-35 hours a week, things were going well.  Then I spent 12 weeks at 25-28 hours per week.  

Found a 5 day/wk work schedule, left that first job.  Things are much better. Considering I just quit less than a month ago I guess I can answer this. I've been working in pizza restaurants now for the past ~5 years. The latest one for about 1. Everything was going perfectly fine but then our chef left. The guy that replaced him has 0 pizza experience and so he mainly worked on the line ( only consisted of 4 staters and 2 pastas). Whatever, he deferred to me when it came to the pizza side. My wife and I went on vacation to visit our families for two weeks and apparently shit started hitting the fan. One guy complained the other wouldn't prep anything, the other wouldn't prep because there was nothing done for him the night before so fuck the other guy....bla bla bla. I get back and the place is a fucking sty. Flour everywhere, dishes that haven't been washed and my lowboy was disgusting, inside and out. Later that day I found out that the dishwasher quit so we had to call in an old dishwasher to come in, he got there late and so said he'd do the dishes in the morning, okay fine, shit happens.... Except this happened another 3 times over the next week. On my last day I was suppressed to work the night shift. I walked in to see that again, no dishwasher AND the owner's fiancee was having her bridal shower (or bachelorette party idk) in one corner of the restaurant. Immediately I call both the chef and the owner asking what the fuck is going on. At this point I made the mistake of not choosing my words more carefully but I was way past my boiling point. I tell them that I need a dishwasher asap and that one of them needs to get the fuck in here now. Owner felt disrespected, I didn't give a fuck and I told him I needed to get to work. He called me back 10 seconds later demanding an apology to which I countered with fuck it, I'm out.






There's much more to the story but I'm on my phone so I tried to condense it as much as I could.

But yeah that's my story.I worked at a call center for all of three days.

That was literally the longest that I could last, and I was up with guilt-ridden nightmares for both of the nights in between. The thing is, I wasn't working a sales gig (at least not in the traditional sense): I was a "talent scout" for an incredibly shady organization that sought to trick parents into purchasing "acting and modeling lessons" for their kids.

There was more to the pitch and the process, of course, but that was the general thrust of things. I'd call people up, enthusiastically recite a script, and then book them into "one of our last remaining slots." The kids and their parents would arrive on Saturday or Sunday, go through a fake audition (complete with fake casting agents), and then be instructed to call a given number on Monday morning.

That number, of course, would connect people right back to the call center. They'd be told that the "casting agent" had *loved* their child's audition, but that they - the kid - needed to get some additional training. The parents would then be suckered into paying thousands of dollars for six weekends' worth of completely worthless classes... with the caveat that their offspring would be summarily expelled if they missed even one session.

Unless, that is, they paid even *more* money to have their kids stay in the bogus class.

**TL;DR: I could only handle three days as a call-center con artist.**I've quit a few jobs over the years, so I have a lot of stories. Some of them are sad, some are funny, some are entertaining, most are boring. But if I had to pick just one, it would be this one...

My first job was as a Telephone Psychic. I don't know how many people remember, but I worked for the company that would advertise as [Miss Cleo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxopPDMq7rs) 

Now, to work this job you had to be 18, but fuck it, but I'm 15, and how are they going to know right? So I sign up and do my required test phone calls, and I'm in like flin. I'd call up and sign in, and people would call me up and ask me to do a reading for them, when I was done for the day, I'd call back up and sign out.

The pay wasn't bad, it was something like $14.99 an hour, except they only counted the time you were on the phone, not time in between calls, still, not bad for a nerdy 15 year old in like 1997.

Turns out I'm not nearly as good at spit-balling shit as I thought I would be, so I studied a lot of stuff like tarot cards, divination, numerology, astrology, I Ching, Rune Stones, also downloaded some free/freeware/cracked software to help me.

At first it was just fun as hell, but then it started to bug me. Like, I'd get these calls from the back bedroom at a house party, and some party guest is using their host's phone to call me, and they have no interest in wrapping things up since the bill will not go to them.

I got a pretty good gig going, I work about six hours a night, long shifts on the weekends, do my homework, go to school, make more money than my parents. Get really good at it.

Except I have this nagging in the back of my head: "Illiterati, what you are doing is wrong." Keep getting worse and worse calls: "Read the cards and tell me, should I send my daughter to live with my parents, or keep her knowing I smoke meth in the house?" Things stop being fun. 

I will never forget the call that broke me. Some woman told me she had "ruined" her marriage to her husband and sent him away, because she thought he was cheating, but now she didn't know. So she says: "**Tell me, is he cheating, or am I wrong? Because if he is cheating I will go kill him, but if I am wrong, I will kill myself.**" They gave us a list of numbers for like crisis hotlines and drug abuse helplines, and I gave them to her but that's not what she wanted. She said: "No no, you are psychic, just tell me what really happened so I know what to do." I told her I had no psychic powers, and was infact a scared little 15 year old boy and the whole thing was a scam, there was nothing I could do for her, but please don't do anything you'll regret later. 

I hung up the phone and dialed out, and never called back in. My last check came like two months later.It was a shitty job and the owner was a complete asshole, but I stuck with it a lot longer than I should have. The last straws were a) not taking care of/being mean to the cats that lived behind the restaurant (he kept them there on purpose to keep mice away) and b) hurling racial slurs at and being a condescending dick to my Hispanic coworker. She was 14 years old. 


I stole and re-homed four or five of the cats when I left.had my last day at work today, I quit thanks to the fact I was still a temp a year into the assignment, I was making $8.75 in a trade that usually pays $12 or more and the fact I would never advance in the company. Bias against the night shift. We had mandatory surprize meetings, which started when first shift arrived and were settled in. My subordinates were so sick of it, they would say to go ahead and fire them if I had to for leaving. 

Other shifts got catered food for working overtime, every time. We worked the most overtime, yet our supervisor wasnt even allowed an expense account,  90% of the time we got nothing. Even if we were meant to get food, there were times when the other shifts would eat all the food reserved for us. Id go out and buy everyone donuts with my own money to make them feel appreciated.

When our department was going through a big floor plan rennovation, the 1st shift lead was taken into the meetings. I was the 3rd shift lead. I and the 2nd shift lead had to cover 1st shift. We were working 12-14 hour days, 5-6 days a week, week after week.  

After  2 months of this I quit, and the 2nd shift lead begged for a demotion.I worked at a casino. I called the cops on these kids doing drugs in the parking lot. The owner then claimed that she was being charged $50 for the phone call and that I should only call the cops "if there is a gun to my head or a knife to my throat."

Oh yeah, the owner just so happens to be my mother-in-law. I quit the next day and my husband and I haven't talked to her since.For about a year we had 10-14 hours required weekly OT.  They wouldn't announce how much was required until the week was already half over. I carpooled and had a 40 minute drive each way. The OT was never going away. I had to drive myself several days a week due to this. They refused to properly staff the team.  One Thursday they told us we needed 14 hours of OT by end of day Saturday. I couldn't take it anymore. Texted wife to confirm she had my back and then walked in and gave 2 week notice. Within 2 months I was employed at a better place making 25% more. I used to work at Mister Car Wash as the receptionist. Just remember that, guys. I was the *receptionist*. It was literally just my job to answer phones and hand people whatever flavour air freshener they wanted. That's it.



Well the lobby of this car wash had a big ass salt water fish tank in it. No kidding, this tank was over 500 gallons. It was enormous. At some point before I started working there, whoever was supposed to be maintaining it stopped giving a fuck. The water was so green you couldn't see through to the other side. All the fish were dead and rotting, and this thing was swarming with nasty worm things. And for some reason management decided that it was my job to clean up this stagnant box of sludge. I had to empty this entire thing before my shift ended or I was fired. They gave me a 5 gallon bucket and told me to start bailing, while also doing my receptionist duties. Yeah... By the end of the day I didn't even get the thing half empty. I had an out two hours left on my shift and my manager began to yell at me for not having this massive thing empty and moved outside to be picked up. I couldn't even reach down far enough into the tank to bail all the water out, let alone move this massive thing outside. So I just stopped, grabbed my purse, took my work shirt off, and yelled "fuck this, I quit!" And that was that. Fuck Mister Car Wash.


EDIT: I dropped my phone on my face and it posted before I was done.Boss expected me to 'help his son with homework' which was essentially tutoring him for as long as 2 hours after my shift. Pay was shitty anyway. Stress. 

I have depression and I couldn't handle the customer service and being perfect and working extremely hard for little pay. I enjoyed my coworkers and stuff, but it was time to move on. 

I feel if I hadn't moved on then, I could be way worse off. Or even pretty close to dead and not just inside. I thought I'd take a chance & date a coworker. This ended up being high on the list of life regrets. Supervisor was constantly yelling and verbally abusing specifically only me.   My work was enough for 4-5 people and in fact was divided by 4 people when I left. 

She eventually explained to me that she had a job once where everyone was yelling and how she "thrived" there.  In shock, I told her my "communication style" was slightly different (aka normal and don't respond well to screaming.)

After I left I realized this intimidation process may have been related to the fact that I handled the AmEx statements and saw a lot of *interesting* items on the company card.  Felt that the trade I was in was going to bore and make me hate myself after too much time. Quit, went on a 3 month trip, two and a half years later I'm in a more interesting sky's the limit trade which already eclipsed my old salary. Two years without any sort of recognition or advancement. Not even a raise. Gave them ample reason to reward me and ample opportunity to do so before finally pulling the plug. It was my first job out of law school. I was told I would be working under an experienced attorney. Turns out that not only had that senior attorney quit before I started, but he was dissolving the company's partnership.  This means that after the partnership was officially dissolved after two weeks of my working there, it was no longer allowed to be a law firm and we were all practicing law illegally. I got in their faces for fucking with my career and gave em my resignation as soon as I found out. [removed]Traded a night shift for a day shift; took a big pay cut so I could see my son off to daycare and sleep in the same bed as my wife.###Full time Nanny story

I quit my nanny job because the mother was trying to extort me for my taxes. She wasn't abiding by regulation. She was paying me 10.25$/hr for 3 kids with mental deficiencies but telling the government I was getting paid 15$/hr. Since she's a single mom, she kept getting 12$/hr back from them. She milked me and managed to make money off of me while she had a job.

I was okay with this since she was a single mom so I kept it hush hush under the rug. But then she tried to make me pay my own taxes (which is illegal considering the laws abiding full time nanny work). I expressed my opinion on the subject and showed her the law that states she has to pay. Instead of paying it and keeping me, she replaced me as soon as possible under my back.

I could have went to the authorities but I knew sanctions would be taken against her and I didn't want to screw the kids up. So instead, I just got fired like a fucking idiot, swallowed my pride and got used.Quit three jobs, all shitty customer service ones.

First was a cash advance location. Pretty depressing the kind of people who walk into that place.

Second was a cashier at an airport terminal Hudson news. The antique credit card machine took so long to process that people would be late to their flights, and I'd get yelled at.

Third was an inbound call center for the Franklin Mint. Idiots call in and buy gold and silver "clad" (fake) coins, and we had to read a script that tricked them into signing up for re-occuring shipments, which were nearly impossible to cancel.I got laid off, but was already actively looking for a new job so I consider it more or less the same thing (especially since I've already started at a new one). That said:

I was a technical writer at a large corporate network security firm. I "left" because the job was kind of cushy, easy, and static. I was occasionally challenged with learning new content in a field I was not super familiar with, and loved the problem solving of articulating complicated topics in an understandable way. Unfortunately, that's about where my ability to influence the product ended. I didn't get any input or influence into product features, how the marketing should look, the best way to position the product, how it was talked about on social media, or really *anything* except how the documentation read. The text I did get to write had to follow a fairly strict, boring style guide, and I wasn't able to determine the formatting or design of anything except what color and method I used to annotate screenshots. I made a ton of money and got to work from home, but was miserable. (I fully attribute being miserable to a manager that took over my small team, but that's another story.)

I started my new job with an education tech startup. I have to wake up early and drive an hour to get there everyday, but I love it: in the two and a half weeks that I've been there, I have been asked to review/provide input for literally everything that the public will see about an upcoming feature. This includes social media/press release review, being invited to participate in daily standups where my input has not only been heard but included in the product, and as the only technical writer in the company, have full authority to write, publish, and design the documentation as I see fit. The pay kind of sucks, but hey, my wife just started a new job herself with a significantly higher salary.I worked for a computer services company that had several management figures that were, well, DICKS.  Just a few months after I started, the AV software we used for our customers networks quarantined a windows file that caused servers to blue screen (this was a world-wide issue from the virus def, nothing WE did in IT).  Management solo'd me out, CURSING at me belligerently, claiming it was my fault.  I was in shock over how much of an ignorant ass this guy was, and to this day I wish him hell.

My last straw was when they replaced 3 helpdesk personnel with me, a sys admin, to save money.  I gave them a year to get me out of there and back to a sys admin role, but I covered the engineers asses (several of whom did poor implementation and generally didn't give a fuck) and did the work of three people.  During that time, I worked 50-70 hours a week regularly, on call 24/7 most of the time (still expected to be in promptly by 9am even if I worked ALL NIGHT), and saw no OT pay, no bonuses, and no relief.  I was even sent home one morning at 7:00am to change because i was wearing jeans.....I was there since the day before fixing their fucking shit.  I was scolded when i came in late at 9:15.

At the end of the year, I asked for a raise and be a sys admin again.  They told me I didn't deserve a raise because i was just helpdesk....they even changed my official title to helpdesk technician.  I put in two weeks notice, and they offered me an extra 10k a year to stay.  I said f them.

5 years later, I make over twice as much as before with a company that saw how skilled I was.  I still wish the manager hell.

*Bonus: a buddy of mine who worked there after me sue'd them for unpaid wages (OT) and WON.It was an outdoor job, fundraising on the streets of a very cold city (yes, I'm the one pestering you to donate to save the environment. Yes, I hate me too.) 

I was spending 8 hours a day on the street below freezing temperatures + snow and sleet. With holes in my shoes. Constantly being rejected all day long, ignored, treated like I was invisible, and having people say rude things to me. I felt like a failure at my job for not pulling anywhere near the numbers of donors I needed.

I worked almost entirely with men, as a young, 110lb female. The cold got to me quickly but they pushed me to get through it. 

I was also going through a lot emotionally. I had recently left an emotionally abusive relationship, and the guy was continually harassing me. I went from living with my parents and seeing my family all day every day, to being gone all day, eating dinner alone and crashing on my sisters couch. 

One day I spent the majority of work crying in a Walgreens bathroom, wanting to die. The next day, after my lunch break I couldn't get myself back outside. I laid in the restaurant for a while then told my boss I was going home. Day after that, we had a meeting in the morning and I just lost it. Someone said something motivational about having something to live for, and all I could think about was how much I wanted to die. I was uncontrollably crying, and told my boss I needed to quit for my mental health. 




I quit my job when I realized I was busting my ass seventy hours a week to make some faceless shareholders rich... Seventy hours a week not including commuting, parking, and eating garbage for lunch. Then at the end of every year I'd get some trifling raise and a "good job" and that would be that. That would be my worth for the next 365 days. Unless I got caught in one of the frequent layoffs. Then I'd get severance. That would be the closest I ever came to a windfall.

I realized this when I was twenty-five. It blew my mind. I was Mr. Frickin Anderson in *The Matrix*, but without the cool night job.

Two months later I handed in my resignation and went into business for myself.

EDIT: and worked more like 90 hours a week... [This](https://www.quora.com/What-do-people-who-work-70-100-hour-weeks-do-in-their-free-time) is a really interesting glimpse into people who pull massive work hours.I quit after being shot by the guy who stabbed me months earlier in an armed robbery.I was working for a pretty small company as an "office manager." My boss was not a morning person and preferred to start after noon and work late into the night, which I guess is fine since it was his company and all, but I was required to arrive in the morning, be alone in the office until everyone else decided to show up and only leave after my boss did. I was usually in the office from 9 or 10am until at least 9pm for no real need. I was also given dumb, literally impossible assignments and then yelled at in front of everyone else when I couldn't complete them. On top of everything I was hired as an independent contractor on a day rate with no overtime and no benefits. Fuck that life.At my last job, I worked in a nutritionist's office and I am fully convinced that woman is the devil. Just the worst excuse for a human being I've ever met. Everything about the job was miserable, and she was extremely disrespectful to her employees (it was only myself and two other women in the office).

But the breaking point was when she told me to schedule an appointment that didn't fit with the schedule. I just wanted to double check with her that she had an updated copy of the schedule and wanted me to schedule the appointment that day/at that time, because there wasn't enough time to allow it and I didn't want to get my ass chewed for it later when she realized that. After just trying to politely confirm it with her, she looked at me and said, "You shut the fuck up and do what I tell you to do."
 
I somehow resisted the urge to slap her across her face, and instead just walked out and never went back. I had one of my coworkers send my final paycheck to me. They went out of business a few months later. The fear of unemployment and career setbacks is a constant. The fear of walking in the door every day and going through the hell of severe anxiety in a toxic environment increased until I couldn't take it any more. Four months out of the work force and I sent my first application yesterday.I did the whole long distance thing with a really abusive guy that had worked at a summer camp the year before and I broke up with him a few months before we both returned to camp. He made every day a living hell for me, but the straw that broke my back was when I confided in a good friend of mine about what I was going through, and she slept with him anyway. I didn't care who my ex slept with, but the fact that a close friend chose to seemingly not care about me or the pain I was going through was the breaking point for me, since all three of us worked in the same department.

I quit the next day because it wasn't worth working there anymore.  Bonus: When I visited the camp two years later, I met my now fianc. severe crippling heat stroke.    I was constantly puking my guts out and it was 150 degrees.  boss said he didn't care so I said fuck you and left.People don't leave companies... People leave people.

I empowered myself to start looking for a new job, found a great opportunity and resigned. 

On paper, The company with think I left for a better role, and they will convince themselves it was unavoidable but really the catalyst that got me looking was some bad people at the top. I worked for a number of years for a state supported living center assisting people with disabilities. I worked on a "difficult" dorm, where people that had committed various violent crimes had been committed after being deemed unfit for jail or prison. 

Because of the behaviors involved and some incidents that happened during a different shift during my last six months there, our required staffing was higher than our actual total staff pool - we would require 17 full time aides, but the maximum a shift would have (before people called in sick or had days off) was 12. This was during days. I worked nights. In the morning, we would be "held over" for mandatory overtime in order to cover the difference, usually for the entire shift four out of the five days of the week because they wouldn't be able to find 5 people willing to come in for an extra shift. All that overtime was good, but it got old, quick.I quit a cooking job that had piss poor management. It was in a hotel/bar and I served the restaurant and cooked, then they decided I had to also serve the bar. As the only cook this was just too much to cook and serve. If it was slow, it wasn't bad but if it was busy then it was a nightmare. 

After one particularly shittacular shift I had enough. The next day I called my manager and told him I wouldn't be going back. 

"You're kind of fucking me here..."

"Well I'm sorry but I can't handle it anymore."

I was also going to university full time, and I had another job so the stress of everything just added up by this point.I refused to cater to a bunch of neurotic, entitled, swelled head cunts.Was in Louisiana for work got a call from a family member say my grandfather passed away. Went back to work the next day and hadn't seen my boss all morning went to check on him. Found in hotel room had a heart attack in his sleep. We had to fly him back home on the private jet with us very weird atmosphere. Got back decided life was to short and hated my Job and quit a week later.I wanted to start my own company. I had saved up over $100k in cash and stock to try running my own startup, so I walked away from a job that was paying over twice that per year to follow a dream. Zero regrets.I was a no call no show to my help desk job because my wife had gotten into a serious car accident on her way to work. 

I called her (my boss) an hour after my shift had started to tell her what had happened and she told me "That is not my problem, your wife should have been a better driver, get your ass in here now or you're fired". At the time, it had a $750 severance package, so I just hung up. She fired me, I got my $750 and that was that. I spent four years at the same job, delivering pizza.  I liked my job.  My buddy helped me get it and even though it was stressful as fuck sometimes it was still the most fun I'd ever had, till the last day.

I came in early to do some non-work things off the clock in the mostly empty restaurant.  My buddy, now a shift manager, came to me and asked if I'd clock in early.  Before I could *even say yes* he started yelling and screaming at me about showing up to work early and refusing to clock in.  I couldn't get a word in through his invective.  After he stormed off, I heard a couple customers laughing at me.

I packed up my stuff, prepared to clock in, and went to talk with my buddy so I could get his computer authorization to clock in.  He starts yelling at me again with the same bullshit, where both customers AND employees could hear.  Again, I couldn't get in a single word because he interrupted me so much.

I marched into the back office, grabbed a piece of paper, and started writing a letter to the store manager.  I felt sick.  I wanted to throw up.  The other employees that heard came to see if I was all right, and I started crying.  By the time my 'buddy' came to apologize, I was having a panic attack.  I couldn't stop shaking, I couldn't stop crying, my neck hurt from tension.  I'd already finished making copies of the letter for him and one for myself.

It was the most humiliating experience of my life and I have not spoken to him since.  I didn't work for a year and a half because I was constantly afraid of being humiliated again.

And if he reads this, he's welcome to talk to me *in person* about it.  I doubt he will and whatever friendship we had before was burnt to ash, so whatever.  He's still working there, and still a manager.I used to work at McDonald's, it was my first job at 16. I worked there for about a year when 2 employees pulled up to the drive through and one of them was hanging out of the window bare assed with his money shoved into his ass. I gave them some choice words and shut the window. My manager came back and berated me for not helping the customer. I tried to explain but she wasn't having it. She thrust the money at me and demanded I take it. I casually took my headset and visor off set it down. I calmly looked at her and said "I quit. That money that you have in your hand was shoved in his ass." She had an immediate look of fear and shock in her eyes. The next day the store manager called and told me he completely understood. He apologized profusely, I told him it was fine but I wasn't going to continue to work there. He gave me a solid reference anyway which landed me my next and still my current job. However, I'm about to ditch this place too.I got a better one. After a year I saw the place for what it was worth: A dilapidated, poorly-ran nursing home with inept staff, slacking managers, and corrupt, money-hungry directors that pressured me to do unethical practices that the goddamn company was already in a federal lawsuit for.

I was burnt out. I didn't care anymore. I felt like the patients needed help beyond solely what I could provide and the staff didn't care enough to put any of my plans into effect.

My stress and anxiety got worse and worse. Around the year mark, I thought "I didn't go $65,000 into debt and through 7 years of full-time schooling to feel this miserable and insignificant." 

Fortunately I recently got out of there and in a position that I love and feel like I'm doing the work I was meant to do. I feel rejuvenated, alive again.
My mat leave was up when my kid turned 1 and I couldn't bare the thought of going back to work. I didn't like my job and my bosses were assholes, and I love being at home with my now 16 month old. Sometimes I almost feel guilty for not being a "working mom" because as social pressure where I live, but for now I enjoy it and I no longer have fleeting thoughts about getting hit by a car just so I wouldn't have to go to that horrible office that day..Distance and low pay. I've never quit for any other reason.What made me quit my job? Well I was a group leader for a Honda manufacturing plant and was being asked, no I was demanded to work anywhere from 13-14-15 hour days some times 6 or 7 days a week roughly did this for months on end it was taking a toll on my body and made it real hard on my marriage. During these months I was not allowed time off when I developed a health issue that was occurring, couldn't take time off for two funerals of close family, and I was on third shift we were required to be at the plant Sundays at 630 so any holidays that landed on Sunday I missed.

I could go on and on and in more details about a lot that I've encountered while working at this place but I haven't talked about it or gotten it off my chest since I've left this place and it could get awfully long winded.I had the opportunity to buy an established restaurant for a reasonable price.  Having a blast so far!I got compassion fatigue. Was working in long term care and hospice and would openly say things like, "I hope this guy dies before the weekend."

Because if they didn't, there would always be a staffing issue that would wake me at 3 am on a Saturday night, and I would fully be expected to handle it while not getting paid. 

It's a dark field. I quit a retail job a few months ago. I put in my 2 weeks notice but I ended up walking out. I quit because it was too dangerous. People were running in and stealing designer jeans and it became MY job, as one of two males working at the store, to chase after them and get their license plate number. For minimum wage? FUCK THAT! I almost got ran over doing it and that was pretty much the final straw. Actually I take that back. The reason I walked out was because I literally watched a guy steal and then lie to my face. He was on drugs, kept calling me racist and then eventually waked out with the items. After he left my manager proceeded to chew me out about it. So I walked to the back counter, flipped a coin, walked out and never looked back. 
Being berated for calling a customer an imbecile. This is after said customer used a myriad of colorful words trying to describe my intelligence. Oh and I was on the 18th hour of my shift after coming in at 3:30 in the morning. God I don't miss that one.Worked at a Christian Bookstore for 7 years. Was very religious when I took the job. About 4 years in I became atheist yet I was comfortable enough there I stayed on. I even went on 3 mission trips they paid for to Haiti and Guatemala thinking it would help my spiritual life. Great trips but no help at all.  Gradually just hated waking up in the morning knowing I'd be doing something I completely did not believe in. Finally realized it was not only not fair to myself to work there, it wasn't fair to the customers either. Quit, got a much better job 3 days later. I came to realize that my job didn't have a useful purpose to the world. I worked at Marketing and our main task was to find ways to sell more.

I left it one year ago to find something I really liked and that had a good impact in the world. Now, I'm really depressed because I just can't find it and I'm spending most of my days locked at my room doing nothing.
My first job as a programmer was basically me sitting in front of my work pc waiting for my boss to have time to give me something to do. They had an open floor plan, so I couldn't just goof off on the internet all day. After half a year I was so bored that I couldn't take it anymore. 

I quit my "job" as a freelancer because customers are shitty. They didn't really know hat they want, but at the end of the project they wanted things to be different from how I did them. They didn't want to pay for the work they contracted me for. They expected me to be there for them instantaniously, to work over the weekend etc. After 2 years I said "fuck this" and went back to college to get my MS. Now I work at an engineering firm. Our customers are fellow engineers. They were knowingly employing me for illegal lengths of time and made me do work that I was not legally allowed to do. 

As a minor, I am not legally allowed to work more than 3.5 hours on a schoolday and I am not allowed to operate dangerous machinery without being supervised by someone over 18. The machine ripped off my (18+) coworker's hand. The labor board got on the company's ass and charged them with like 60+ child labor law violations plus a 10,000 fine for making a minor work a dangerous machine. Quit before they could fire me.New executive chef brought his drug addict, sex offender friends with him. Drove off our entire crew. I was just trying to stick it out until the end of summer when I left to finish school. Got cornered in the cooler by one of the addicts saying he was going to cut me if I didn't stop telling the owner about him and his friends harassing the high school girls we had as hosts and table bussers. Went upstairs, shut the grill off and killed the pilots in the middle of one of the busiest nights of the year and walked out. I was also the last one there that knew the recipes for our house specialties, since nothing was ever written down and the new crew didn't bother to learn them.Pontiac dirtbag who couldn't make it in the Cleveland mob - a liar and a snake... came in and fired best two sales people and in their place, hired a completely inexperienced high-heeled ho that he knew from the "old days."
Then he was calling people in the office and lecturing them on how "things are going to change around here."
I waited until it was my turn to sit across from his desk and invited  him to come outside, "cause it was nice out."
I told him, "I'm done."
I quit on the spot.
'Cause fuck those kind of people.They promised I'd get to work 1x1 with medic's and run some 911 calls.  Instead most of my transports were dialysis or psych patients being released from jail, I was running hard and learning little.  I left after 3 months for better pay, benefits and opportunities at a competitor.  I realised I was working in a foreign country as a carer when I could go home to australia and work as a nurse... plus I'd been overseas for 7 years at this stage... it was time to leave!Just quit my job yesterday. My boyfriend and I worked at our local pizza place. It was a great job at first, although one of the other employees constantly cursed and shouted when she wanted to speak. Said employee told my boyfriend that she "didn't give a fuck," that she was telling a story. He had told her there were pizzas on the makeline. She was telling that story to our GM.

Boyfriend and I take a trip and come back. We'd been planning on moving next year, but we find out we can move a lot sooner. So we tell our GM.

For the past two weeks, I feel as though we've been treated poorly. She bought everyone else in the store something yesterday, but when my boyfriend and I ordered a pizza (that we were paying for) she told us she didn't want us eating that during the dinner rush. At all. That starts at four, I believe.

People constantly brought their problems to work and talked about them. Everyone constantly cursed (usually not in front of the customers) and talked about things that weren't appropriate for work.

So we said goodbye to our favorite people. Waited until one of our shifts was over and both left. Our manager came outside, yelled at us and told us we had to come to work this weekend, and then walked away while saying, "Whatever. This is bullshit." My boyfriend called to let her know he'd work this weekend but she told him not to worry about it, that what we did was unreasonable. Then she hung up on him.

She's a good person but not really a good GM.I had found my perfect job, you know the one that you don't care to go work because you love it. We changed manager and the one they chose was just there at the right time, they needed someone and took her in.

I got told by many people to be cautious because she was an evil bitch but I decided to give her a chance and learn to know her instead of listening to rumors.

A year later I left for medical reasons, to take time for myself. She bullied me to a point where I doubted myself.

She went to HR (new staff) and told them whatever they needed to hear in order to redirect all the mistakes she did and put the blame on me. I got accused of several lies, but couldnt argue when it happened because they did it all in english, you have to know that where I live we have laws that give us the right to have all communications in french. They purposely intimidated me in order to make me sign the damn papers.

I got stressed out and for the first time in my life I couldnt talk and tell the truth, how things really happened. They (HR & Manager) sat me down in an office where all employees could see me, between the two of them and because I couldnt speak they told me I could get fired for not cooperating. 

I was down, on the floor, tired, stressed out. I had spent the last 2 years trying to help my other coworkers with their problems with previous management who got fired. Nobody helped, talked or supported me even if they knew manager had been lying on the points I was accused of (time stealing, private information stealing...) I spent the next month trying to breathe, it was too much. Burn out. 

I left for several months, depression. I'm still on medical leave, I can't go out without stressing out. I shaved my hair, because I was so depressed I just didnt care anymore about washing it. It was in a perpetual bun. I decided to quit the job after 8 months, I got told that she had put the staff on watching me at all time, she wanted to make sure she'd get a real reason to fire me.

It's been 10 months and they still refuse to pay me my due. I had to contact lawyers in order to get things moving, still waiting.

Karma is a bitch though, they shut down the store because it was a complete mess. 

I put on makeup for the first time in a year and a half recently and felt good. Oh yeah I was a makeup artist... for one of the biggest company in luxury products. They make millions each year but refuse to pay me whats I'm due. 


I haven't left yet but I will be soon to go back to school. I was already gonna go, but my friend's sister passing kinda triggered a weird lucidity of fuck... I could die at any time. I'm not gonna die in this dump.I posted right after I quit [here, a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hmk0g/i_quit_my_job_today_i_know_it_leaves_my_old/?)

Short story is that management were incompetent and hired a wide range of people, they never pushed people who were mediocre employees, only transferred their work to more competent ones who ended up getting overwhelmed and quit or got fired for refusing to take on more.

I was one of about four people who left before they took notice that the *good* workers were leaving and the bad were staying.

So they tried to feed the bull by the ass and fired a lot of people they thought were the problem because they were showing signs of being overwhelmed too, and it turned out they were some more reasonably OK workers. They were left with the laziest most incompetent of the lot. The place collapsed, and was split & sold off earlier this year.My husband and I were given about two weeks notice that we were moving out of state. We had already had a hell of a year and were trying desperately to repair our relationship. I tried to off myself a few times, just all in all a bad year. My coworkers never noticed or said anything, except demand that I work faster and faster.  
  
While I was in another state, with a real estate agent, literally looking at houses, and stressed out so badly from constantly driving back and forth, I got numerous texts demanding to know when my projects would be done. I had never missed a deadline or turned in anything subpar and still they acted as though it was an inconvenience for me to be finding a place to live. I was also not salary and they expected me to be on call anyway. I quit and jus left them hanging. Fuck those guys.  
  
They hired a new, HILARIOUSLY bad graphic designer in my place, and I was still getting texts up until about a month ago requesting information on how I did things. LOL NO. I figured everything out on my own, and we texted the previous designer ONCE, a week after I started...and that was it. AH they just made me so mad. What an absolute cluster fuck of a job.My boss used an error on my timesheet as leverage to deny me a needed raise. Put my two weeks in. Gotta spread my asscheeks and fly.Drove tow and the Owner was one of two sons who inherited the empire so to speak. They each got three locations, the other brother ran those three well and all was fine. The brother I worked for had run two into the ground and I was hired to work at the last surviving one. 

This cat knew the business and ran a tight ship. He even expanded this location into a tire shop and light maintenance and build an impound yard onto it. But was still slowly running his business into the ground because keep any staff. He liked to scream and belittle people. Threaten their jobs, their pay, their hours and so on. 

I was really young when I got the job and he loved to remind me how he was "giving me my big chance" and he "took a risk" cause most people wouldn't hire someone young, let alone a girl, bla bla bla.

I clear probation, clear AAA vetting, sheriff vetting and frankly I end up being one of his best drivers inside six months. After nine months I'm supposed to get a review and start getting normal pay, not the hire pay. But he keeps giving my niggling little excuses about how I'm not ready and I need to prove myself. Maybe if I get a class A license (already had a class B) BLA BLA BLA. At 18 months it became apparent awhile that he just couldn't afford to pay me right and was dragging it on for as long as possible. 

The final straw though was when I come back to the yard after a fucked up call. Some tourist had gotten snow chains wrapped around the rear axle of her Outback, IDK why she thought she needed chains or why they were in the back, I didn't ask, she was cute. ANYWAY, I sorted it all out, in a dirt driveway a day after it rained on top of week old snow. I was spotless except for accidentally taking a knee in the mud when I lost my balance. I park up my rig and walk into the bays and he's bullshitting with one his buddies that hangs out at the shop all time. They're both like walking around a brand new Tacoma and talking about it and I assume it's the buddies. As I'm walking up their conversation makes it clear that it's the owners, he just cashed it out. 

When he sees me he spots a little pancaked sized mud stain on my uniform and starts to ball me out, top of his lungs and in front of two other crew, about staying clean and professionalism and "Y'know I was just about ready to move you to standard pay but now I'm not so sure!". He's waving his arms around and screaming at me, "Sick of your shit Kalipygia, your lucky I don't fire your ass" and I just fucking had it. I was done, I stepped right up to him, right in his face, I told him to shut the fuck up, do not speak another word, if I hear you speak I'm gonna beat you to fucking death. I'm done, I quit, I'm gonna put my keys and radio and shit on your desk and I'm leaving if you ever speak to me again they will never find your body, if I have to come back here to get my final pay I will burn this place to the ground, and than I left.

It was stupid and in truth I didn't even make it two blocks away before I had to pull into a 7-11 and shit my brains out (stress shits are the worst). I was lucky he didn't call the cops and I got my check in the mail inside two days. I liked driving tow but this asshole ruined it.

TL:DR Arrogant yuppy sexist verbally abusive asshole screwed me on pay for too long resulting in me threatening murder and arson.I got tired of earning more money than I needed.  I was buying things I didn't really want, and certainly didn't need.  It was making me a rubbish person.  I quit in March and I've been doing not very much for the last few months.  Currently I'm selling most of my possessions, and trying to find a simpler way to live.  Time is more valuable than money, we all know this, yet not nearly enough of us do anything about it.I worked for a place for 3 years.  Super small business,  enjoyed the job but the business owner was kind of crazy/flighty/not sure how she managed to stay in business.

My hours were unreliable as hell, no benefits whatsoever,  but I stayed and made things work because I genuinely cared about what I was doing.

One day I come in to work, and she tells me I have been "late" for work.   She knows as well as I (and the cameras) do,  that I arrived at work well before business hours, and that the only reason I appeared "late" was because we had recently switched from writing our clock in times on a paper time card,  to clocking in on the computer,  which I would often forget to so until I had been at work a good long time.

She had a piece of paper and told me I needed to sign it saying I would accept a pay cut of nearly 2$.   I said no way was I signing that.   She very icily said "Well I guess you have a decision to make then". 
And I said "No, I don't". Got my stuff, gave her my key, and walked out the door without another word.

This was someone I considered a friend of sorts,  I had shared a lot about my life with her, listened to her annoying wishy washy drivel day in and out for 3 years, for very little pay and shitty hours, and I was extremely insulted.   I really feel like it stemmed from me not ever wanting to participate in Bible basher talk with her.  I'm not religious and this is the Bible belt,  she is intensely religious and while I would never have openly stated my beliefs/lack thereof,  I was also not willing to talk religion and it had come up with greater frequency in the weeks leading up to that.  Can't prove it, it's just what I feel.

I got forced out of a position once.  I was middle management working on the business' collective dream.  Actually I was the Director and Architect for Ops and all thing backend.  We were in beta releases of our new fancy product that was to change the world when the CEO pissed off the Chairman of the Board and CEO of the bigger parent company of our company.  So my CEO got replaced, who brought in a new CTO and COO who forced everyone out of the company.  But after a massive lay off including me being forced to let everyone of my employees go and being ordered to take down the entire automation grid and code source servers, effectively wiping the product out of existence, I knew I would be next, I had little choice but to resign (Quit).First job after graduation was Oct 2015; I sent in my resignation end of January 2016. It was a pretty sweet job. Profitable industry, coworkers were great, environment was casual, and I had a bunch of international business trips lined up. A dream job for a recent grad. I had to refund an $8k plane ticket on my last day, even though I had plans to visit my family on that trip. 

I quit because my VP was a huge pain in the ass, and the management team is extremely cliquey. While our team is quite small (magnifying the issue of a cliquey management team), I realized this only after a week long business trip with the VP. She was completely unprofessional, berated the team in the presence of clients, micromanaged without any degree of competence. We were all working 19 hour days, going down in the same ship - chill the fuck out, lady! I'm usually quite collected -perhaps only because I've never had a reason not to be- but I told her that I was finished after this meeting was done. I quit the following Monday. 

I've learned from old coworkers that many people have quit due to her, and her alone. I'm starting a new gig next week :)Was on FMLA from my phone customer service job because I tried to move around after being there for 5 years. One jerk off complained that I wanted to get off the phones and the job he was interviewing for didn't deal with that, but he was a company prick.

I told him, yeah, I want to get off the phones because I want to advance. Had a couple of more interviews within the company and they all went the same way. Finally went on FMLA for a couple of months and when they were just being complete assholes, I just quit. Just went by to grab my shit and left. I had an argument with another girl about ptsd and military folk. She and a few others were goinng on about how military folks with ptsd were crazy and should not be in public. I am former military with ptsd. They knew this. Gave no fucks. Management, who was right there, gave no fucks. So I gave no fucks about coming in. It was the last straw after a year of bs.I quit a job once because I didn't like living where I relocated to - Hawaii.  It sounds a lot better than it is.A better job.I worked at a hospital with people who didn't care, management who didn't care, administration who didn't care. Patients were numbers, employees were numbers, and the amount of disinterest in anything other than rules and money was astonishing. I currently work at a different hospital and the atmosphere is tremendously improved. Poor management.  To explain, they didn't know how to manage their employees and yelled at people using sticky notes.  Didn't have the respect to talk it out rather instead leave nasty notes.  Not to mention they were violating the health code and refused to fix it.Lack of appreciation or any real future path. Was constantly told by managers and the owners how I was one of their best and favorite employees. Was passed on for promotion for a few years for less experienced (and IMO worse) employees. Finally decided I was done with it and moved to another place doing the same thing for way more money and much more enjoyable. My managers told me that I was too young to be stressed even though I have bipolar type schizoaffective disorder and at the time a girlfriend who was constantly threatening suicide and self harm.  They confronted me about rumors that I might be quitting and told me that if I quit that I would be letting my illness win.  I handed in my 2 weeks as soon as I stepped in the door for my next shift.  A week later, I got a much more fun and rewarding job that payed better than what my old managers were making.  After I left, one of them ODed on Cocaine and Meth during their shift and fell unconscious on the floor.  Me and my friend who worked there with me laughed when we found out. i had to make the choice of finishing college or keep working and i wanted to make sure to finish schoolI got more incentives to write ClojureThe negativity, hypocrisy, and mediocrity, in both professionalism and moral character, I was surrounded by.My sister works where I used to. I quit there because my sister asked her bosses husband pick her up something for her from where he was at the time and she saw on her bosses phone "tell the cow I'll pick it up." So my bosses husband called my sister a cow and I was raging mad and realized that my boss never corrected him or stood up for my sweet sister. So I couldn't work there knowing my boss had no respect for my sister. It was Walmart.. Poor management, poor training, angry customers. I realized there were plenty of other jobs and it wasn't worth the stress. (This was while I was in school).I worked for a state university. I was required to sit in a seat even though I was waiting on 5 emails that needed to be vetted by 3 people first before j could copy and paste the changes from the dev site to the live site. It was very relaxing but a waste of my skills.The stress was killing me, literally. My blood pressure was crazy high, I was vomiting several times a week, my whole body hurt constantly, and I was having almost weekly panic attacks. 3 weeks after I quit my blood pressure was down and I felt healthier than I had in over a year.I wasn't smiley enough (the company motto is *Pleasing People* so you have to have a smile pasted on your face all day). It was a retail job.

Also I had two customer complaints.

For the first one, there were a group of teenagers just messing up the toy area. I didn't really care, I'd fix it up after they left. The dad was visibly frustrated (this was after they'd eaten in the restaurant part and paid so he was ready to go home). He asked "can I just leave them here?" The girl at the cash stand said "don't worry, I'll put them to work" and I replied with "nah, we don't hire unruly kids." For some reason that really pissed the mom off. And she left a complaint or something on the website. Thing is, it took *two weeks* for my boss to reprimand me or whatever. Boss told me that the next time I got complained about, I'd be fired.

The week I got in trouble, a woman, her daughter and the grandmother spent at least two hours just fucking around in the toy area. I had to ask them (nicely) not to put toys in the moldable sand demo (it was moon sand or something and the girl was putting stuffed animals in it and burying them. It's ridiculously hard to get that stuff off of stuffed animals). The grandma was clearly unhappy that I asked them to not get things dirty. Then I walked up later, when the little girl was crawling around on the floor and in between tables (with merchandise underneath them. She could've knocked everything over) and asked them to please stop making such a mess. The mom snapped "how are we making a mess? You let those boys throw darts and they could've hit my child" (the darts had a magnet nub  and I made sure both the boys knew not to throw while anyone was walking past and I made sure the girl was distanced from the board). The mom made sure she got my name before she left.

I said "Fuck it, I'm gonna get fired anyways." So I told the mom that she needs to control her kid otherwise she'll be a monster as a teenager.I worked my ass off in a grocery store for over a year, but I wasn't "cool enough" to work the service counter.  Working at service counter meant a large pay raise. A guy that worked at service counter (but was super lazy), made $3 more an hour than I did.

This popular girl in my class made service counter her first 2 months of working there. 

Also the assistant manager was so fake. He had this fake, loud laugh he did a lot.  The manager just had this big fake smile.I loved my job but knew I couldn't keep the ruse up any longer 

That and I found a job in Japan Nearing the end of my two year internship, I started to go through some medical/health issues, and I couldn't safely perform half of my duties that involved lifting and operating machinery. Upper management was understanding of this and left me easier tasks to take care of front-end (mostly secreterial-type responsibilities) for a while, but the person I was shadowing was a complete insensitive asshole and continued to leave me back-end shit to do while I was expected to work completely alone in the building. 

One day, I tried to power-through and perform one of these back-end tasks that was purposefully left for me by this person (they had stayed late the previous day, giving themselves extra hours but did not complete it on their own), but I ended up making a lot of minor mistakes and almost passed out while operating. So after that day, I decided that I was going hand in my letter of resignation because I really couldn't handle this person's attitude about my needs while I was still actively seeking help from my doctors. 
I spent six long years working at a fast food restaurant located inside of a hospital. Management was laughably bad; one manager was fired for running a catering operation using stolen food that was purchased by the hospital; the next manager, a close friend of the first, was fired for sexual harassment. The third manager spent 90% of his time ignoring any complaint the employees had, and there were many complaints.

The coworkers were, for the most part, awful; one guy at the restaurant next door liked to scratch his crotch with his gloved hands, then go back to handling raw chicken. If we complained about it, the manager would say "well, I didn't see it, so there's nothing I can do about it." 

I did an internship at Walt Disney World about 5 years into the job, and when I came back my tolerance for bullshit had completely evaporated. I went from an environment where coworkers worked together and were pleasant, and management was responsive and present and actually doing their damn jobs, to the hellscape that was my hospital job. One morning I woke up to go to work and I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. I hated that place so much I thought I'd rather be injured than work another day. So.. I didn't go in. Ever again.I'm quitting next week. Pay that is roughly 40% below the median income for my field, no paid overtime, no respectable bonus for machine installations, boss is a selfish idiot and will always blame me for most problems we have, big or small. I should've left years ago. Just like the previous workers here, they left due to major disputes and unpaid work, they warned me on my first day, I was told my boss would fuck me over any chance he got. Major major red flag. There is no future here. He even lowered my pay slightly this year, that was the final drop.
I have nothing else lined up but I'm doing this to force a change, to break the status quo. It's the only way to improve my situation.Worked for a multinational corporation in the languages industry that had cognitive dissonance and dismissed the idea that language and culture are indissociable. They treated all of their int'l employees the same: crappily, with no regards to local cultural standards. (They tried convincing them the good ole American way was the only way to be successful.)

Got tired of that, and left.
It wasn't what I'd studied, I was ridiculously overqualified, the pay was very unimpressive and I wanted to start my own business. To be fair none of these were a surprise, I took the job fully knowing that I'd be gone within months, I just wanted to save up money for my self-employment plans!This was my old job - currently VERY happy in a new position.

Long story short it was a temp position anyways...supposed to last 3 months sep - dec. I find out my dad is going on hospice in early oct so I fly across the country and tell my boss I'm sorry but I have to be with my family and I can't finish my assignment.

They were incredibly understanding and kind about the situation - even offering to let me take 2 weeks and then come back on board but unfortunately with hospice and funeral prep and just in general needing to be with family it took me over a month to get back on track.
I worked at a movie for six days. It was awful.
The movies playing included Basic Instinct, Far and Away, Encino Man 

Here are the two reasons I threw my awful red jacket at those awful people
1) The manager told me to refer by her last name....
2) At the end of the day we would take the popcorn out of the container, place it in a trash bag and then put it back the next day...
3) They charged for extra butter. They told us to charge for extra butter even if they said no because most people would not pay attention. 

[removed]I worked in the nursing home my grandmother died in, my supervisor told me I couldn't go to her funeral. It took me a few months after that to actually quit because I was only 17 and didn't realize I could just quit. I was offered to work in my field (diesel tech) instead of just the occasional vehicle, plus it had better pay, better insurance and an actual shop. I have been working at the new place for less than a year. The first 6 months were great, learning new things, rediscovering things I had learned, and getting some nice overtime. Then we got a new manager and he merged two mechanic departments into the same building, cut me from maintaining my almost 50 vehicle fleet to barely 15 vehicles, and never took me searious. So now I am secretly looking for a new job and everytime I have to go to an interview and need time off I just tell him it some kind of state review board for diesel techs. Dude is clueless. I moved overseasMy first job I left because I was pulling way more than my own weight as a part of the dining staff for a retirement community, had gotten multiple out of job description responsibilities placed on my shoulders that I gladly took on and did successfully. My immediate manager spoke very highly of me and said if he ever left I'm getting his job. When I asked for a raise after being their for almost a year  they said lets talk about that during your yearly review. With insanely positive remarks from all of my co-workers and manager they were "unable" to get me a raise. I quit on principal for doing more than my initial job without seeing a raise. businesses need to realize that when you treat your employees like people instead of just another resource you get drastically better and hard working employees.My work hours slowly went down from an average of 25 hours a week to one day a week for four hours. I kept asking management for more hours and they just kept saying there's nothing they could do. I was the only one in my department getting these hours, with everyone else still getting an average of 20 hours a week. I got fed up with it and quit.

I was so done with them that I didn't even put in my two weeks, because hey, I only work one day a week for four hours, I might as well not even be there.I was working at a coffee roaster where I was hired as the "roasting assistant" for way less than I was making as a manager of a full fledged coffee shop just two weeks earlier. It turned out to be a hipster fraternity where the only way you could fit in was if you could afford "specialty" "high end" things in your life. 50-60 dollar bottles of scotch, ridiculously pretentious and overpriced food, and the only person who couldn't afford it was me as the lowest paid employee at 10/hr. I worked 6 days a week for 10+ hours a day just to fit in. That's it. I loved this company so much that I became a slave just to fit in. I developed some health problems that made it so I couldn't drink coffee, so I was isolated and ridiculed for it. I stopped getting invites to work functions, no one spoke to me even though I was bagging hundreds of bags of coffee a day and waking up at 3 am on some days of the week just to run deliveries and then work until 6 pm. It was hell. When my boss and the head roaster (other boss) pulled me into the back room and basically patronized me by repeatedly asking what more they could do for me since I had doctors appointments and had to leave early some days because of panic attacks, which was in a very demeaning and childish way, my eyes welled up with tears and I just told them I quit. On the spot. Find someone else to bag your fucking thousands of pounds of coffee for the next month while you find some hipster on a trust fund to do my job. The worst part is that coffee was my passion. I spent so long honing my craft and love for it. That company took it all from me. I don't want anything to do with it now other than a paycheck. I was around the age of 13 Riding my bike with a friend and holding his skateboard. Was just a street from his house and i lost grip of the board just off the side of Route 44 highway in Florida.

The board slipped, i grabbed it but lost balance and my foot flew off my "pedal" (the pedal fell off a couple weeks earlier and was nothing more than a metal bar) i threw my leg back to the pedal but my leg was lower and the bar was pushed into my leg scraping bone. 

I saw my friend riding and screaming away  from me before i blacked out for a few seconds.

I woke up on the side of the road a couple moments later, and just felt an unbelievable amount of pain and looked down to a puddle of blood forming at my legs, just pouring out. i oriented my leg right so it wouldn't just pour out and just screamed for what must have been a total of ten minutes unable to move an inch without pain being shot through me. 

Finally some people in the house i was in front of came out to find me lying there on the side of the road white as a ghost from the blood loss  and got my parents from across the highway to get me to take me to the hospital. the last thing i remember that day was passing out inside the doors to the hospital. then waking up almost a day later.

I promptly beat the ever living hell out of my "friend" after he came by about a week later. I also screwed up the stitches and have a scar on my leg now.Had a bullet ricochet off of a slough and hot the ground 3 feet to the right of meHad horrible chest pains late one night, could barely walk half a block to the nearby gas station to buy Tums (Had to stop and sit for several minutes along the way). Hoped it was just heartburn, but couldn't be entirely sure I wasn't in the process of having a heart attack or something, the pain was that severe.

Had a similar "attack" a year or so later, this one far worse. Taking antacid didn't touch it this time around, so I sat in my fourth floor apartment for about an hour not knowing for sure if I was gonna live or die. Eventually it subsided, shortly after I threw up.I was scuba diving in Australia, 1 instructor, and 3 of us newbies.

I was the youngest, and when we first got deep the water, and swam off to our location, I had to swim arm-in-arm with the other two scuba divers as we followed our instructor.

We got to a point where we could let go of each other, and sort of 'look around'. 

This giant turtle swam past me, and being a fairly young, animal loving girl, I decided to follow it. I must have only followed it for about 30 seconds, but when I looked back to see what everyone else was doing, I couldn't see anyone.

Needless to say the panic kicked in. 

At this point, the turtle was kind of just chilling in place, and so I just stayed with it, wondering what on earth I was going to do. I wanted to swim up, but I remember being told if you swim up too quickly, you can damage your lung, so I basically just freaked out next to the turtle.

My instructor soon found me, gave me something (grass?) to feed the turtle, and then made me follow him back to the group.

After the dive was over, he took a photo with me wearing his hat, because I was 'brave.'Very little experience with any water sports and zero experience with Scuba, was given a brief two hour class before being taken out to see a sunken ship while on vacation. Instructor was very poor and the current was as he described "ripping" and when we come up when we're done the boat is nowhere in sight no landmarks around whatsoever and my stepfather is passed out, so we float there for a long time and eventually the boat found us but I was fairly certain that we were all going to drown.Courage in the Big Stinkin City...When that chick got raped on that roller coaster while her boyfriend was being chopped up into little bits at the factory..everestMy boner.I'm gunna say sportsisis shit give it 4 months before totally fadesI like to hope it's the misuse of words like liberal, conservative and radical...

r/hfyA birdKiller whale... Smart, no real predatory threats.Water bearBecause instead of finding help and support you're more likely to be doubtful of people and suspicious. They have ingrained the exact opposite behavior of a psychologically healthy interaction with supporting people.because that's when you learn how the world works. if you are an adult you already know how the world works so you know people aren't supposed to do what is happening to you.It depends on the nature of the abuse and the person. Perhaps the child (and later adult) is left feeling that they in some way deserved it, or that something was taken from them that they can't restore. It might leave them feeling broken, empty, corrupted, you name it. It's hard to convince them otherwise because the past is immutable and their memory/perceptions only slightly less so. self worth is lost and hard to build up to full confidence id venture to say no expert tho parents only just now starting to mentally torture meBecause it creates physical changes in your brain. When you are abused, your brain changes in order for you to survive. 

We have a system in our brains to help us sort out what is dangerous from what is not, but if everything around us is dangerous, thats not useful. It will drive us mad and it will impair our survival. It would be like a smoke detector that is just ringing constantly, even when there's no smoke or fire.

Once abused, our brain flips a switch with coping mechanisms that prime you to develop a psychological disorder, and its very difficult to hit the reset button.

The body turns the smoke alarm off instead of having it ringing constantly. This helps in the immediacy, but then the person has a very difficult time knowing when they are in danger or when they are safe.  

Abuse most often occurs from people that the child knows, adults who are supposed to love the child. If a child experiences trauma at the hands of an adult who is supposed to protect and love the child, the child's brain gets its "wires crossed" to put it in a simple way. It associates "love" and "normal" with pain. This is why often abused children seek out circumstances, like abusive relationships, which aren't good for them, but make them feel "normal" because "pain" is normal. Pain feels like home. 

Chemically, your brain starts secreting more adrenaline, more easily than a normal person would. You are more likely to have heart problems and digestive problems. Adrenaline is in the same family as dopamine (reward, feel-good neurotransmitter). If you are releasing a large amount of a certain neurotransmitter, it will actually damage the receptors and make it more difficult to use them in the future. (This is why hard drugs like cocaine wreck your brain.)

In addition, experiencing abuse will also change your genes. You are born with genes that effect your neurotransmitter levels and receptors. If you are experiencing abuse and you have one healthy version and one maladaptive version of a gene, the maladaptive gene will become activated, because again, in the moment, your body is responding to it's original need to survive. It is trying to "numb" the pain for you, banking on *if you survive* than you have a chance of being healthy in the future. If you do not survive, you have zero chance of passing on your genes.

You release more stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol is more likely to make you overweight (survival mechanism) because your body is assuming that your environment is unpredictable. For thousands of years, "stress" in nature meant that it was hard for you to get food. When abused, your "old brain" processes the abuse as information that suggests that your basic needs are not being met and you could be deprived of food at any time.

After your brain experiences abuse, it also prunes it's nerves in a different way. It shrinks the amygdala, the emotion powerhouse of your brain. It is the neural equivalent of being bruised. Also, the neural pathway between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex does not get as developed so it is a smaller, weaker connection. The prefrontal cortex is the newest part of the brain, responsible for thinking, judgement, and decision making. The weakened connection makes it more difficult for the individual to self regulate (self-soothe) their own painful emotions.

This is why psychiatric drugs can't just "fix" depression by getting the neural transmitter levels right. It isn't just the neurotransmitters that are wrong. Certain parts of the brain are over developed like the fear pathways while other parts of the brain are underdeveloped. In addition, the wiring is crossed in a way that it shouldn't be. The brain is amazingly plastic and is very good at rewiring itself, even in adulthood. The problem is that it takes extensive time and effort in therapy to undo these connections and rewire new, healthy connections.

If you are interested in a very detailed explanation, Bessel Van Der Kolk's book "The Body Keeps Score" is an excellent review of why this is difficult not just for children, but for anyone who experiences trauma. It is written for anyone. You don't need to be an academic to understand it.You have no idea what "normal" is, so you're more inclined to ignore red flag/manipulative/sketchy behavior in other people so spouses and friendships are often toxic even deep into adulthood.Google Play All Access.

Also, drowning. The idea of drowning keeps me up at night.CindersDying too slow.Bugs, insects, jumping animals, giant dogs, possums and skunks.Adam Sandler movies At a party, years ago, I was in my late teens, probably around 17 or 18. I had a few rum and cokes with some friends around a table, and we each just happened to bring out a bag of weed at the same time. In total, we had around 5-6 grams. We busted it all up and split it in two piles (horrible, drunk idea), when one of my friends shows us that he had gotten some hash oil and spread it all over a paper before he came. So naturally, we decided to smoke a 2-3 gram hash oil joint. 

After smoking it, I walked to the corner store to get a Coke, which was about a 2 minute walk. I opened the store doors and everything began looking as if a strobe light was going off. As I walked through the store, everything in motion was fragmented. Pretty freaky looking, but whatever. I've got this. I get my coke, talk to the store owner for a few minutes, and go back to the party. 

The party is crazy. The music is loud, there are lots of people, a few fights break out at random times, but all-in-all, it was a really good party. I don't remember anything after around 2am.

The next morning I wake up on the lawn. I still have no idea how that happened. Later on in the day I'm talking to a buddy of mine that had been at the party, just trying to fill in the blanks. He hadn't drank much, and has never been a toker. I bring up a conversation we had the night before, and he has no idea what I'm talking about. I bring up something else we had been all talking about, and he says "Yeah, WE were all talking about that. You sat on the couch beside us, dead silent and wide-eyed."

Turns out I had internalized pretty much everything I had said after getting back from the store. I went to the store a few days after, and as soon as I walked in the store owner burst into laughter. Apparently I walked in ultra slow motion to the cooler, stood about 5 feet back from it and tried to reach the handle repeatedly for close to 5 minutes. I eventually figured out I needed to step closer, I guess, because I did buy a Coke. A 500ml bottle, which I gave him a $10 bill for and immediately left (he gave me the change when I got there later, haha).

I didn't really do anything "cool", but I think/hope my long-winded story fits.Last year I tossed my lighter to a friend who needed to light a cig. When I tossed it, he wasn't quite prepared, and the the lighter bounced off of his chest and back onto my coffee table, landing upright. Both of us just had the combo shocked disbelief/retarded grin "did that just happen" look for a good solid 30 seconds before we broke out in uncontrolled laughter.I wrapped my dick around the back of a pick up truck and..well, you can imagine what happened next. It wasn't pretty.When I was 14/15 I was high as balls, hanging with my Uncle. I picked his 22. Off the table and, with out double checking, shot myself in the left foot.

Once.FADE IN:

INT. A COLLEGE DORMITORY - MORNING

*A young man wakes up to the sound of a loud crash. This is BEN. He sits upright in bed, his eyes wide.*

**BEN:** Hello?!    
**GRANT:** (*O.S.*) Sorry, dude! Sorry!

*A second young man walks into view. This is GRANT, Ben's roommate. His clothes are tattered and stained, his hair is a mess, and he looks to be covered in both burns and dirt.*

**GRANT:** (*CONT'D*) My keys melted last night, so I had to break the door down again.    
**BEN:** What the hell, man?! You could have knocked!    
**GRANT:** I didn't know you'd be here.    
**BEN:** I live here!    
**GRANT:** Well, yeah, but how was I supposed to know if you were here *now?*    
**BEN:** There's this thing called knocking. I mentioned it three seconds ago.

*Grant scoffs and rolls his eyes.*

**GRANT:** Don't be stupid. Who knocks on their own door?    
**BEN:** That's not... ugh, whatever. *How* did you lose your keys, again?    
**GRANT:** I told you, dude: They melted.    
**BEN:** Melted.    
**GRANT:** Yeah.    
**BEN:** Keys don't melt.    
**GRANT:** They do when they're made of ice cream.

*A moment of silence passes.*

**BEN:** Okay, so, what you're *really* telling me is that you went on some kind of bender last night.    
**GRANT:** Nope. I was completely sober.    
**BEN:** Are you forgetting the *first* time you broke our door down?    
**GRANT:** It was going to suffocate us, dude! The room was all closed off!    
**BEN:** That is the *purpose* of a *door!* Look, just tell me what happened, alright? Maybe we can go find your keys.    
**GRANT:** They turned to ice cream, and they melted.    
**BEN:** No, they didn't.    
**GRANT:** Did.    
**BEN:** Didn't! That is not physically possible!    
**GRANT:** It is when you have superpowers!

*Ben's mouth opens and closes a few times.*

**BEN:** What?!    
**GRANT:** Yeah, see, I got really drunk last night...    
**BEN:** (*Interjecting*) I knew you were on a bender.    
**GRANT:** ... and I wandered into some kind of industrial waste dump. Things are a bit hazy, but I remember falling into a pool of something. When I came out, I realized that I had special abilities.    
**BEN:** How did you discover that, exactly?    
**GRANT:** Well, like I said, my keys melted.

*An exasperated sigh escapes Ben's lips as he rubs his forehead.*

**BEN:** So, that's your power, then? Turning things into ice cream?    
**GRANT:** Not exactly.    
**BEN:** No? Then what is it?    
**GRANT:** I can turn brass into ice cream.    
**BEN:** Brass?    
**GRANT:** The metal they use to make keys.    
**BEN:** (*Shouting*) That's an alloy! It's an amalgam of copper and zinc! You can't turn it into ice cream!    
**GRANT:** Oh, yeah? Then explain our doorknob.

*Ben climbs out of bed and storms over to the room's entrance. Sure enough, a pile of melting ice cream is visible amidst the door's remains.*

**BEN:** That's... I... huh.    
**GRANT:** Told you.    
**BEN:** Quick question.    
**GRANT:** Shoot.    
**BEN:** If you can turn brass into ice cream...    
**GRANT:** ... Yes?    
**BEN:** Then why the *hell* did you have to break down our door?!

*Grant shrugs.*

**GRANT:** The deadbolt was made of steel, dude.

*Ben stares at his roommate for a few seconds, then turns around and goes back to bed.*

FADE OUT.

There are groups where people meet and play board/ card games.  There are programmer/ design groups, hiking groups, photography groups.

The former depends on the alchohol content of what you're drinking and how much of it your drinking coupled with your height and weight.

The latter just comes down to your tolerance. Only as much as you can avoid making your sober friend regret it.One to two drinks per dayI've heard that one a day is the "healthy amount". Although I don't think you're risking your health too much by having 10 a week.5 beers a week shouldn't be a problemKind of depends on the person.

I know that I can't really regularly drink because for what ever reason, even just 1-2 drinks the day before sucks the energy out of me the next day even if I'm not hung over.

Though I also work with people who can down an entire bottle of wine and be fine by the end of the night.

Though in general I've heard that 1-2 drinks per day spaced out can actually be good for the health. Though I don't know how much truth there is to this or HOW it is healthy.

And if you KNOW you're going to be drinking heavily - Go find a blood alcohol calculator before hand, type in your stats, and basically make your "Limit," how ever many drinks it takes you to get into the 0.15 range because any drunker than that and you're going to regret it usually and there is no reason to be more drunk than that.The truth is there's not really enough hard scientific data on amounts on the smaller side and how this affects you but the general nedical consensus is someone without pre-existing conditions to try to minimize drinking, and avoid more than two drinks a day.12 beers every 2 days or a 750 ml vodka every 2 daysGet drunk, not blackout once a month if you need to or on holiday**Attention!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*The first thing I do when I wake up each morning (after getting out of bed) is drink two 16 oz glasses of water.  Our bodies require lots of water to operate at optimal levels, and a lot of folks don't drink enough daily.  I started drinking two large glasses every morning about 5 years ago, and it helped me become consistent in making sure I got enough.  

It was kind of amazing how much I noticed a difference when I was giving my body enough water.  Everything seemed to get a boost (from blood pressure to energy levels) from something so simple.

The reason I'd advise doing it first thing in the morning is because your body has gone without water for the longest period of the day, and needs that replenishment.Exercise daily.Moisturize. Pray or meditate for 15-30 minutes. Well I've heard a lot of bad things about Monsanto.

And sure, there was plenty of partying to be done if thats what you wanted. And, plenty of people spent their Friday and Saturday nights playing Playstation, watching movies, etc. 

That genuinely surprised my adolescent self.
I thought it was going to be a lot harder than high school and I would struggle with my grades. It actually wasn't too badI thought it was going to be all about partying. Partying ended up being everyone getting together to watch "To Catch a Predator"I thought the work would be magic - that there were mysterious secrets that I would learn.  But the academics were the least important part of it.  There are no mysterious secrets in science, it's all just learning how to use mathematical tools and process data.  That was an anticlimax and a disappointment.

But I was shocked at how amazing it was to be fully self-defining my life.  The liberty of standing on a mountaintop with every direction open to me, free to choose my path.  And the dream-like wonder of living in a new city like nowhere I had ever lived before on top of that.

I only care if you try to use that perspective to justify legislation against them.

"I think homosexuality is sinful" = fine.

"I think homosexuality is sinful, and that's why I support a ban on gay marriage" = assholery.well yea, by its very definition. a bigot is defined as someone who is intolerant. so there's that. the fact that its under the guise of religion doesnt, for me, change the intolerance factor. their very dogma prevents them from listening to the better nature of their angels. they might not want to be be bigots. in fact, maybe they dont wholly believe in the intolerant aspects of their religion. maybe they dont care the neighbors are gay; they keep a kempt yard and are happy to watch the house on long weekends. but they're still hostage to their religion. they have to grin and bear it when someone in their church talk shit about the Lidells next door, maybe even agree. youve turned me around on the whole thing op. yea its possible to not be a bigot as a christian, most likely they'd just be a hypocrite.

**edit: words**I think sex working is degenerate but I wouldn't say that to or around a stripper. Just don't bring it up around gay guys. Let them sin in peace like the rest of us.It really doesn't matter what you believe. What matters is how you treat people and whether you respect the rule of law.I'm sure some Christians see it as a sin by definition but still love and accept the person. Just my opinion.Yeah, sure. Its a delusion, but delusion doesn't have to be based on hatred or bigotry by definition. I used to feel something similar. But actually having homosexual inclinations myself always made me understanding. I think it's stupid when Christians pretend like homosexuality is acceptable within their religion. *No it's not! It says it in your book.* It's a constant attempt at denial, so they can squeeze together tolerance and intolerance. I'd rather then either be a non hypocritical Christian who accepts that homosexuality is a sin, or be an atheist who accepts that sexuality is not anyone's business. 

I don't think that a Christian is necessarily a "bigot" if they think that homosexuality is a "sin". It is. Sin is a phenomenon defined by religion. There's nothing inherently " wrong " with being a sinner, unless you subscribe to Christian theology and equate it with morality. Bigotry is not defined by beliefs. It is defined by acts.**Attention!

If the last 7 months were good why would I care?Personality counts you know...If you say looks don't matter, you're wrong. Physical attraction is important, and if you wear enough make-up to look completely different for four months, you can't expect them to feel the same level of attraction. Just don't wear make up every day..I would say "Damn ugly bitch put some make-up on, I'm losing my boner. Also use some perfume because you smell terrible too!"I know this may sound like a silly question to a lot of you, but it is a genuine insecurity for many wome (not all women)
I sincerely am interested in your opinions/adviceI think it would depend on how much "power" the beauty part had over the relationship. I say so because I see myself overlooking a bad

I could also see myself overlooking the less attractive version.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*The Internet has given people who identify as a certain X or Y connections between a whole community of people who feel the same way. In the past, people did not have such connections, but now there is a very vocal minority of communities who want to be recognized. 
Also, society as a whole is getting more liberal and accepting, so these aforementioned manifestations are allowed to take hold instead of being stifled out by those who disagree. 
Not trying to agree or disagree with it, but I am almost positive this is how that came about. That is a question that I would like to know the answer too! I can't understand the big deal some people make it out to be, let's be more tolerant and just accept that we are all a little different from each other. And that is a very good thing. Love is all you need :-) I just think it's natural as society changes. 

In the mid 20th century most western societies attitude towards women and race changed drastically. Society changed a lot due to the world wars. In the 21st century the rise technology means society is still changing. People's attitude towards people who are a little different from them is changing due to there being more information on sexuality and gender. Therefore people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender are becoming more accepted as society progresses. 

Some interesting views expressed here.  I always thought that it was because the younger people are more educated nowadays, more tolerant, more articulate, more aware of social issues.  I'm copying something I wrote in a reply below, so everyone can see it:

---

It's really not [a first world problem]. The only consequence of being a first world country is that a lot more people can come out and claim their rights where they would have been shunned  (or imprisoned) in the past.

 I grew up in a third world country, and have come to know people who are gay or trans and cannot come out because their family and society would ostracize them. There are people who are trans and don't even understand what they are going through because they have no resources. Would you rather that a certain (albeit small) share of the population suffer in silence so that you won't feel "icky"?

I can think of two distinct examples right off the bat where members of the LGBT community were harassed in my home country:

1. [Policemen extorting gay guys](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/K058lcdBKEGvnQrcShRUWN/The-Matunga-racket.html)

2. [The ostracization of the hijra community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia\)): They are shunned by society at large and have had to learn to live in their own ghettos.

You should be proud that you live in a country that is, for lack of a better world, on the bleeding edge of conversations about how to expand human rights. Americans have dealt with tough questions about policy when it comes to discrimination for decades, and have had debates most of the world shuns. Why would you want to turn back the clock? Because lots of people like having nice neat boxes to classify everything into, and those people are throwing a very vocal hissy fit.Gay marriage is over so they need a new fake issue to split people between the two center-right capitalist federalist parties. Because our society has been spending a lot of its time lately seeing just how insidious bigotry against LGBTQ people can be.  Matthew Shepherd's death was a major wakeup call in 1998, and coming only a few years after Clinton signed the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy for the military, things just started snowballing from there.

Honestly, I feel like we're mostly beyond it, and we've just accepted that LGBTQ people are a part of general society that aren't seen as "less than" heterosexualit/cisgendered people, and that's really the major win:  when it doesn't matter to people anymore, and they can just accept it as reality and move on instead of making a fuss over what gay or transgendered people do.It is not the Internet. Sexuality and gender identity as issues in American society have been discusses (watch Milk) very heavily since the 70's, read your history on gender and sexuality, so the Internet has nothing to do with it. The main reason is that political and economical forces in this country (political parties, business, media) have all of a sudden figure out the value (their value) of bringing those issues to the forefront, either to promote them or to deny them. The media ( a communication, political, and economic force) also has discovered how to profit from that discussion. So, don't be misled. Yes, tolerance has grown, but that is not the same as bringing the discussion to the upfront since that is the main reason why you ask.Because it is a first world problem.It was always an issue. It's just finally become an issue that can be publicly discussed. It's only an issue with those who are bible thumping hypocrites and those that do not like President Obama or his policies, which would mostly be those who consider themselves aligned with republican party views. Haters gonna Hate. ie.: "Let's make a mountain out of a tiny little ant hill." Some folks just have serious issues with sexuallity and/or gender phobias within themselves.

For the rest of us it's not an issue at all.Because some mentally ill people won't shut up about it. 99% of the population does not have any sort of transgenderism and dysphoria and we've been getting along just fine. we are transitioning from a dignity culture to victim culture.   
In an honor culture, each person defends and supports their own pride stucture  
in a dignity culture it is assumed that we will respect each others pride structures and to maintain civility offenses are addressed not by the individual directly but by a regulatory authority (police)  
In a victim culture it is assumed that NO one respects anyone else without societal pressure necessitating the creation of special victim classes with socially mandated acceptable handling and interaction protocols. The central authority still existing for major offenses but assumed civility is replaced by a hyperreactionary pack dementia in which honor is gained both by exposing your every fault and flaw as a feature or facet as well as by attacking any perceived slight against yourself or better another with aggressive speech and thought shaming......with the understanding and expectation that the person can do nothing about it without A. validating the attackers beliefs and drawing in more "knights" or B. drawing the ire of the regulatory authority 
More kids are changing genders nowadays.  Schools have to make rules to or not to acommendate themsimply because of repression and the pendulum effectBecause it distracts from underlying issues like exploitation and class differences.Because the Kardashians, Caitlyn Jenner specifically. Nobody cared until they made a thing of it. Because people are fucking thoughtless Some people are rigidly attached to labels. They believe people of a certain gender must have to fulfill all the stereotypes of that gender. 

Do you have a penis, but don't enjoy choppijg down trees or working on your car? Have you also been known to enjoy the occasional chick flick? Congratulations! You can't possibly be a Man, you must be this gender that I just made up, because all Men enjoy these things. Everybody seems to think I'm anti-LGBT. I fully, 100%, support them. I simply want to know why so many people are turning it into a national issue. Because all the other issues facing America are handled by the uber-rich.  This is what the rest of us are allowed to grapple with. Because we're running out of things to be offended by and tumblr doesn't rest... at least that's what I think.It's actually not an issue to the vast majority of Americans. But the Dems are trying to make it an issue before the election. The Dems played the race card and the woman card very effectively in the past two elections but now those have lost much of their potency through baseless overuse so they're trying to make trans a thing. I suspect it will backfire and they will trundle out the same old tired race and women cards. It's all about political agenda-setting.Cause until relatively recently the only accepted thing was a white straight man, as we move forward I guess we as a species are accepting new things. Who knowsIt's as big as it ever was but until recently the cost benefit to coming out as trans whatever was too lopsided. There was no way someone could openly cross dress in 1990 and have any sort of stable life. Mix thay with pc culture refusing to acknowledge it's a mental disorder (body dismorphia) and here we are.People think the world is moving around them. I could care less about your gender or sexuality. Do whatever makes you happy, you don't need to shout it out loud.Only for conservatives. The basic rule is "if we can't alumina the their ability to marry and be happy, let's limit as many other things as possible to make them unhappy/punish them for their sin." 

So we get conservatives allowing (encouraging by making a non-issue an issue?) businesses to refuse service to them specifically, disallow gender-specific public toilet use, etc. it's a "wedge issue" that the Democrats are using, IMHO mainly to distract from Hillary's scandals. 

get everyone yelling at each other about transsexual bathrooms and maybe they'll forget that the Democrat nominee for the Presidency is under investigation by the effing FBI, something that has never happened before in the history of the FBI.  [removed]The only place I ever hear people talk about this stuff is redditBecause it's a big election year and every little issue is being blown way out of proportion by our current President to get attention.  POS!Because so many people don't want to be ordinary but they don't want to put the effort to be extraordinary. 

So, to claim that you are part of some obscure minority is the easiest thing to do to stop being boring. Or at least, that's what they believe. 

Because they will be the first ones to use the phrase, "I'm not like the others, I'm (fill in the blank.)"No, have you?Cheated on my boyfriend with my boyfriend This is funny. If you get me."Oh dear me, I have far too much money and I don't feel like spending it on anything reasonably priced!"Still haven't had one.A blow job

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*It has been over 3 years. I am really just not going out and meeting or interacting with people. I'm Wheelchair bound, and live it the middle of nowhere. To be honest, I've kind of moved past the point where getting laid was anywhere on my list of priorities.For me it has been nearly a year and my barriers are self confidence and body image. :(11 hours ago. And let me tell ya, it hit the spotA week

It was me losing my v card. It was a one time thing thanks to the Internet. I'll be surprised if I get laid again in 2016.2 years. I'm also an introverted asexual who sets unrealistic standards for women I date, so there's that.Last time was in February. I broke things off to "find myself". It wasn't a lie though. I'm really trying to improve my health and outlook on life.Its been awhile since I just got out of a relationship. I wanna have sex with no strings attached but dont know how to go about it. Ive tried the whole online profile but its not for me.13 years. I'm asexual.about a year. when it happens its just spontaneous, i'm not actively lookingA long time. And sadly, my boyfriend.It's been since last August.  I wasn't looking then but it just happened.  Since that time, I was hospitalized after a grand mal seizure, and after that I've just been too busy making a living and reworking a lot of things in my life.  I don't have the time or energy to put into pursuing sexy time.Coming up on 5 years. Depression and anxiety mostly. Yesterday, the spawnling was off at a sleep over and so we could take our time and make as much noise as we wanted. It was ***Good***.20 years, previously religous beliefs now lack of confidence and lack of opportunity 17 Years, four months, ten days, fours hours, 14 minutes. My life.Well I'm a virgin so...

As for why, it's because the apathy set in long ago.All these comments but no one is upvoting the post. :(Been 1 year for me. My fiance and I decided to wait til we got married. Inability to interact accordingly with the opposite gender.Running is calming, and classical music is even more so.Go to the gymSomething about the calm concerntration of knitting always helps merhythm games are a good mind and time killerReading is another thing that works. Just anything that is relaxing, like reading novels.I make something out of wood, go fishing, take a long drive, or ride MTBAnything that requires your immediate attention.  Gaming, work out, reading, etc.

Avoid mindless activities like watching TV (unless you watch something that really grabs your attention).Honestly I'd probably just stay in the US. It's not perfect, but weighing all the things I deem important for a place I want to live, it still comes out on top. Barring that, Japan.Pitcairn Island. One of the most remote inhabited places on earth. Singapore. It's a free countryI would disappear into the Himalayas. Find a large cave with a hot spring in the back or right outside. Dock it out with big flat screen TV's and hook it up to the internet. Get some artwork and hang it around. Get a big bear rug. Get a couple of dogs. Be a resting point for the occasional hiker. The southern Island of New ZealandI like the sound of Switzerland.

* Stunningly beautiful

* Amazing healthcare/Standard of living

* Multilingual society

* Their public transportation is top notch

* Political system seems like it's decentralized and close to a direct democracy

* Tends to have a very high rate of happiness

I could go on. Although, no where is perfect; the dream of going off and living somewhere tends to be a lot more different than the reality. It's also an unrealistic choice for myself, as it's quite an expensive place to live, and i hear that it's extremely difficult to move there unless you live in the EU--even then i hear it's very hard.

Would love to take some trips out there though.Somewhere cold with good internet and I'm set. Not sure where that would be, though. The WallWherever she is, honestly.Action Launcher 3's pretty nice, but I still don't really have a problem when I switch to my iPhone.AndChat. There is just no good IRC client on iOS.None. iPhone isn't inferior to android and I don't understand the hate towards iPhones that I always see on here. [removed]I mean... probably none. When you balance it out, there are many great apps only on iOS, too.

Now I personally would never use an iPhone. I think more than apps, it's like "What basic features would make you choose Android over iPhone?" and the answer would be like, customization, control over device, and the ability to handle the content of my phone separate from its parent company. (Bloatware notwithstanding, and only then if my phone can't support a root.)Norton Security and Antivirus

Can you believe iPhone users don't have antivirus software? They think that just because iOS doesn't have the same high-quality levels of malware that Android does that they don't need it.

Wake up iSheeple![Merchant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bearface.games.merchant&hl=en)I have apps that I use often that aren't available on iPhone without jailbreaking, and even then they won't work as well on iOS, but I wouldn't go as far as saying ownibg an iPhone is "silly".

Things like my file browser, being able to replace system apps with new default apps.Because I don't have a loathing personality of visual disdain towards him, and downvotes will be made due to blind hatred, I have to first make a disclaimer: I don't support nor will ever vote for Donald Trump. 

I don't think he can do that much damage that Congress, the Supreme Court, and the armed forces wouldn't intervene first. 

Most likely he'd cause damage by doing nothing. He'd try some things he has promised, but screw up and complain. This would lead to him resigning or waiting out four years and not getting reflected. 
 Sell the National Parks to himself for $1 and then sell them back to the US government for a trillion dollars each.

Award himself a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Lease the White House to Vladimir Putin.

Order drone hits on anyone who makes fun of his wig.

I really, seriously wish I was joking.  Fucking guy is a dickless psychopath incapable of handling criticism.The worst that he could do is choose a reactionary and regressive far right wing judge to the supreme Court. Doing so would set the balance of the court to the right. Therefore with Congress, which already controlled by the Republicans, and Trump could get pretty much any bill made into law. If there's push back, specifically a legal challenge, the now Republican leaning court could shut down the challenge. 

Two examples which may be the result of this would be the termination of gay marriage and the termination of Obama care. Both of those which are now law could easily be repealed. Also Abortion and/or Abortion restrictions can be changed dramatically. 

This is a very real and concerning possibility. 

So if you don't want that to happen vote against Trump. If you do want this to happen vote for Trump. This election, purely due to the Supreme Court nomination, is one of the most important elections in many years. [deleted]Build a wall.
I won't be shocked if he starts building concentration camps too.Undo some of the fucked up things the president before him did.

Let the down votes begin:)Pass a few bills that the republicans are pushing for.Bankrupt the country.Actually enforce our laws....I know it's pretty crazy I'm not sure. I'm hoping congress would veto most of his crazy ideas.Banning all Muslims, even born in the USstart WWIIIAbout 95% of them. I mean, aren't most of them, "Dump that motherfucker!"?

Maybe the word "toxic" is overused on the internet, but that place doesn't seem to recognize how real co-dependency is.Not having to interact with other parents.Nothing.  I enjoy being able to do nothing.  I can sleep in on the weekends, I can relax after work, I don't have to rush to get someone else ready in the morning.

Also, I can actually arrive at places on time; eat out at nice restaurants; travel to places I actually want to go during non-busy times (we always take a trip 2nd/3rd weeks in September, because the kids are back in school and places are much less crowded); have loud, passionate sex with my wife whenever (and wherever) we feel like it; decorate the house with antiques and breakable items...Silence.  I love my peace and quiet.  Sometimes me and my wife will be up talking at like 3AM. And just because we feel like it, we'll just hop up and go to Denny's for a grand slam at that hour. It's not an every day, or even every week thing. But occasionally we like to do that. With kids we can't just up and do that whenever we feel like it. * Being able to go out without having to scramble to find a babysitter.

Everything. Literally everything. I make supper and I'm happy I don't have to tailor my meal to picky palates. I have to do some errands, I'm glad that I don't have to pack an expedition for the kids. I am sleepy? Great. I can take a nap. My car breaks down? I don't have to worry about paying for my car or paying for little pumpkins stuff. I want to go on a cruise? It's so much cheaper and less hassle. Not to mention that I can book it last minute. I want to volunteer as a big sister? Perfect. Don't have to worry about making my own kids jealous. We get posted somewhere else? I don't have to worry about the kids. 

There is literally no downside. 
Freedom. Want to go out for dinner? Go. Feel like banging on the table or in the living room or back yard? Do it. Quit your jobs and spend a year or so backpacking? Why not. Sleep in on weekends, host parties, go visit friends, play games, anything you want to do, you can do it.Basically everything I like to do would be harder with kids.

Weekend gaming binge. Sleeping in. Picking up a few beers on the way home on a Friday night and just kicking back. Going out for an impromptu meal/drink after work. Having friends who don't have kids come over. Spending an hour in the bathtub reading a book. Having a quiet house.I have quite a few nieces and nephews, my wife and I love having them visit for a few days, but being able to send them back when they get annoying is so nice. Can't do that if they're your own kiddos.**Everything**.  

Let me explain: Children are a 24-7 commitment for nearly two decades (Edit: or more!).  They add a layer of expense, complication, anxiety, and responsibility to literally everything you want to do from day to day events to the once-in-a-lifetime events. 

Sure, you can travel and have kids.  It's just more expensive and you have to deal with their whining when you want to do adult things and you have to cave in and do childish things you may not want to do.  Sure, you can sleep in late and have kids, but it's on days when you've hired a sitter or have them staying at a relative - something that takes foresight and planning. 

Almost every aspect of life is *easier* without children... and the ways in which a child makes life harder, it also makes life less enjoyable.Deciding to do things on a whim and not having to find someone to watch the kids. I have better conversation starts aside from "my little Johnny did the silliest thing today.." 

Hint, no one cares. None of your coworkers especiallyThe answer is simple: everything. Every time I hear a child cry or fuss in public, I am reminded of why I still, even at 28, have no interest in actually having a child.

I went out clothes shopping one night recently, a Monday night, around 6pm. I wasn't aware that this was prime screaming child time at the outlet store. The place was jam-packed with screaming children, stressed mommies, and visibly upset fathers. I couldn't take it. I went home, hugged my boyfriend, and reveled in the peacefulness of our household.

I told him that Old Navy on a Monday night is the best form of birth control I've ever experienced.

There's 3 things that I just can't handle in this world: screaming/fussing children, gross shit, and neediness. It's for these reasons I don't have a dog, and the very same goes for children.

I don't think I could do it. Daytime sex in the living roomMasturbating wherever I want in my house.The thing I enjoy is NOT HAVING CHILDREN.  It's really as simple as that. Having children should not and is not the "default" setting for life.  If you want children, then go for it.  The fact that I don't want children is the single best reason for me not having them.CocaineI once said I didn't want kids cos they're "like pets you can't put down" and I got grade-A stinkeye from everyone in the room. I was only joking. Half.Mid 30's single, childfree adult here

After work, I am going to go home and get all my chores for the weekend finished.  I will cut the yard, do my laundry, change the sheets, pay a few bills and then straighten around the house up a bit.

Then I plan on sleeping in tomorrow.  Once I wake up, I am going over to a friends house to hang out by his pool all day...drinking margarita's and generally just be a lazy piece of shit.

Then...Tomorrow night, a couple people are coming over and we are going to have a movie night/drunken board game night.

Sunday morning...Brunch and Mimosas and then absolutely nothing for the rest of the day.  I'll most likely sit on the porch listening to podcasts and taking little cat naps.

Get to bed nice and early on Sunday and wake up fresh to start the week.


Also...being able to go on spontaneous weekend road trips.  Like its Friday afternoon and you call your friend and say "pack your shit we're driving 8 hours to the beach for the weekend" and then just find a hotel room on the ride down.

Or...my personal favorite...just pick a direction and drive.  Where you end up is where you end up. I really fucking enjoy not being around children.Sleeping in

Clean house

Me time all the time

Lack of screaming

Saving money

Sex everywhere

TRAVELING.

I love to travel. I think I'll probably have kids one day. I know traveling with kids will be very different. I hope I can drag along a grandparent or two on trips if this happens so that I don't have to give up everything I want to do.Sleeping in until 11am on the weekends. [deleted]Being able to go do anything almost anywhere ANY time I feel like it. 

Not having my stuff covered in chocolate fingerprints is pretty cool too!Honestly: sleep, free time, and food. My fianc and I have a lot of nieces and nephews that we help watch and spend time with. They are of all ages. The worst is when we let them sleep over our house, and they sometimes wake us up before the sun even comes up. 

The kids constantly want to be occupied and interacted with. They will tell us their bored and complain, even when they are occupied. My teenage nephew will (I swear to God this is true) be playing video games with me, and when he dies or there are load times he plays on his phone! It drives me insane! 

The worst is eating with them. We can never take them anywhere that doesn't have mac n cheese or chicken fingers or something like that. When we are at home, they won't eat anything. My six year old nephew doesn't like to eat, except on his terms. I can make him exactly what he wants and he will still sit there and refuse to eat still. 

My fianc and I are preparing to start having children, and sometimes we look at these things and are grateful we haven't yet. 

Sorry for venting. The silence. 


I have a niece and nephew and their constant talking, which was typically loud because they lack volume controls, actually makes me angry. Seriously, hearing either of them babble on for more than an hour causes me to get angry. 


My nephew is starting to get old enough understand the concept of not shouting everything, but he still talks on, and on, and on. Most of it is about shit I don't even know because it's about 8 year old boy stuff. Like good school and friends. 


My niece still shrieks like a harpy. Sleeping in on the weekends and waking up to complete silence, apart from my cats purring on the bed.

And looking at my bank account and sighing in happiness at all that disposable income.I get to collect lots of awesome nerd things like replicas of Harry Potter wands and Doctor Who figurines. If I'd had children I'd be spending all of my money on them. Smoking weed in my living room. Living without extreme hypomania and the pressure of a world of judgement.

Of course, it's impossible for me really say what I am living without, because I haven't had children to contrast my experience. But, judging from my Facebook feed (as a woman of childbearing age), one of the things I seem to be missing/free of is the most hypomanic experience possible, where one moment you are gushing with joy and love and the next you regret every decision you ever made that brought you to this point. There is a lot of dark humor on my feed about how motherhood is such a torment that they need to swim in a vat of wine every night to survive and they would sacrifice a year of their child's life to just take shit in peace for once. The extreme highs and lows seem genuinely scary. 

Mostly I just enjoy living my life without all the judgement that seems to come with parenting these days in middle-class American life. Judgement that seems to be so strong that it drives people to be way way way too involved in their children's lives, possibly ruining the lives of all the parties. My parents had plenty of time to take shits and do all sorts of stuff -- travel, have sex, spend quiet evenings together not completely exhausted, go out on dates without me every single Saturday. They never had to resort to self medicating with alcohol to survive the process. I don't know why this is impossible these days, but apparently it is.I can have sex with my husband WHENEVER, wherever I want. I can wait naked for him to come home from work. We can bang in the kitchen. We can bang over the arm of the living room couch. We can bang in the fuckin' back yard. We don't need to plan out special little boxes of "sex time."This thread is going to convince a lot of people to not have children.Sleeping in.  

not having to wake up in the middle of the night because someone is crying. 

Deciding to play disc golf on a whim and not have to worry about a babysitter.  

being able to leave the house anytime I want without worrying about packing up a kid or calling a sitter. 

being able to watch anything I want, anytime I want.  

being able to start drinking as soon as I get home after a bad day at work.  

Basically it all boils down to... I enjoy I am not in any way responsible for the health and well-being of a child that would rely on me for everything. 

Don't get me wrong, I love being an aunt to my niece and nephew, but raising a child is a responsibility that I just dont want because it is the biggest responsibility a human can have and is permanent for the rest of your life.  I don't take that fact lightly at all.  We camp in the desert in December and enjoy the winter sunrise from hot springs. We go out to dinner wherever we want to on any night of the week. I run at night, in the dark, for as long as I like. I sleep in or get up early depending on what I need. We decide to take weekend trips, pack, and leave within thirty minutes. My partner and I do pretty much whatever we want to, whenever we want to. Those extra bedrooms we have: we both have an office where we can display the crap the other hates. We never have to censor our language and we can have sex wherever and whenever we want to. Our weekends are ours; with the double income, we really dont worry about money.  That crazy little dive bar we stumble upon at 9:00 p.m. when visiting a new place? Well, we go right in and get to know the locals. I love my child-free life. As a 33-year old woman, I honestly cant imagine ever wanting kids. Childfree and unmarried: literally the only person whose wants or needs I need to consider are my own. Want to buy a new tv? Go for it, me. Want to go on a vacation in the middle of the school year? No problem. I enjoy my freedom.wife and i have no kids, and no plans to have any.  We enjoy traveling, boozing, and video games.  kids would definitely get in the way of that. Saving moneyI appreciate that I don't have to worry about anyone other than myself, for starters. I can allow myself to be completely absorbed by my interests without having to be concerned about anything or anyone. 
And I don't have to interact with other moms who only talk about diapers and ripped vaginas. 
I love that I can spend my entire afternoon in the garden, smoking pot and plant flowers and shit. And the fact that if I want to travel somewhere, I can just drop everything and go. I love the freedom.I agree with everyone who said "Everything", but it's also the fact that I don't have to plan every meal every day (or really any meal any day).  I often find myself not having eaten until 3 pm and with little actual food...not a problem for my grown ass self to make a meal of snack food or go get real food.  If you don't feed kids, you get to go to jail; and if you don't feed kids good food, you wind up with a whole new set of problems.

So I guess I enjoy not being THAT responsible, and I enjoy not going to jail.I am entering into the stage of life where everyone expects me to have kids and be attending PTA meetings. Instead, while they are racing off to PTA and soccer matches, I'm relaxing and playing videogames. I'm reading interesting books and enjoying listening to my albums with naughty words. I can have books out in the open that talk about the sex lives of Roman Emperors and not worry about my kid reading it and asking, "Daddy, what's a sodomite?"

The only bills I have to pay are my student loans and my credit card debt (which is down to 1k). I'm debt-free for the most part, stress free, and I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. It's great. 

That being said, I'll revisit the though of having kids in 5 years and go from there. :)  Money and time.  

I come from a large family.  My father made good money, but we were still dirt poor because of how many kids he and my mother decided to have.  The kids were kicked out at 17-18 years of age.  Because of lack of money and so on, there was no help with car, school, so on.  No safety net after we moved out.  If something bad happened, we were on our own to deal with it.  At the time it was horrifying, but it made you learn necessary skills and responsibilities.  In retrospect I'm very glad.  

However, it taught me quickly that even if you aren't making a great deal of money, if you don't have children, you can afford most things you want.

I love my nephews and nieces, and kids can be cool, but I decided at a young age, there are way too many people out there and I don't need to add to it.  

I enjoy having money to spend on frivolities, video games, traveling, a nice place to live.  Kids are expensive.

I also have time to keep in shape and have healthy meals.  My father had no time for anything with so many kids and we had to eat cheap food.  Healthy food for the most part can get pricey.

Only downside is that it can be hard as you get older to date when you don't much want children. My husband and I both work, make decent money and enjoy our time together. The extra cash and freedom to take a weekend trip to Chicago or buy that 100 dollars worth of makeup sitting in my cart Or just sleeping in on the weekend. And when we don't feel like doing anything we stay in and don't have to worry about leaving the house. Some might call it selfish, I call it paradise. Would having a kid be fun? Sure. I'd hope it would be like on Scrubs, like having a dog that slowly learns to walk and talk but I can't bring myself take that risk if it's not. I really cherish my alone time. I know that if I were to have kids, I would completely be giving that up.Being divorced. Not that I actually enjoyed *getting* divorced, but as a person without children, I was able to move on and enjoy being single with very few entanglements. For people with kids, their kids' other parent is a constant presence in their single lives, with a stake as a co-parent in how they live, who they date, marry, etc.My Mrs and I were done with IVF a year ago. The realisation that we couldn't have a kid the conventional way, then couldn't pull of IVF either, gave us the opportunity to console ourselves with holidays and alone time that we might otherwise not have been able to enjoy.  For example, just a few months ago, we took off to Scotland for a few days, which turned into three weeks, just because we could. Sure, there are sad moments of reflection, especially if we see babies on TV, or when we're out and about, but we have several nephews and nieces who light up our lives when we see them, which we appear to be doing more and more often these days.  Looking forward to our next drive around France, with no agenda or schedule. My mates are envious, but I know they wouldn't swap their lives with their kids for anything. We're getting a puppy!It's not really one thing...it's the never ending list of things. When i talk to people with kids basically their whole life outside of work revolves around the kids. Frankly it sounds dreadful.

I like being able to come home, take a dump in peace, go out with frineds if I feel like it, walk around naked if I want, take an unscheduled trip to Maine, etc etc. If I had kids my first obligation would always be "but what about little Johnny".

Also, i do know some parents that like their kids. I also know about an equal number that really really don't like their kids and have little secret fantasies of getting away from them. That part of it is just a crapshoot. Some kids are good and some are bad and i think that's genetic.literally everything is better without having sticky, leaking, nagging, whining little narcissists trying to bend you to their will. probabley even tortureSo many things; the only person I need to dress and get out of the house in the morning is myself (plus I can go straight to work, never have to take anybody to daycare or anything); if I get sick, I can rest and get better without having to look after someone at the same time; traveling and seeing the sights in new places is so much more fun without anyone whining that they're bored/tired and want to go home; sleeping in; having a quiet and uncluttered living space; do fun things ex tempore; gaming in peace; grocery shopping; have exactly the kind of relationship with my SO as I want without anyone hogging my attention from him; give my pets all the love and care they deserve; spend an entire evening sitting on the sofa, watch my favourite shows and do crafts without being interrupted by someone demanding something from me every five minutes or having to worry what a kid might do/eat/drink/destroy next. I'm a touring musician. I know plenty of families have a parent who goes away on business frequently, but I wouldn't want to do that to a child, and i'm nervous about how it will go when/if I get married. Everything? Everything involves less stress. Literally everything.I get to sleep ~~in~~I can decide to leave the house whenever I want. If I decide I want ice cream at midnight, I can get in the car and get icecream at midnight. 

I can watch whatever I want on TV, whenever I want. I don't have to worry about whether or not there are little kids around who will be emotionally scarred by watching Hannibal. 
Literally everything makes me glad I don't have children. Silence. Peace. Alone time. 
God a screaming kid would ruin that so hard.
Also a million other reasons but that's my biggest. Literally everything. 

The certainty, the ability to move, my unruined body, my financial freedom, my solid marriage (that I could leave if it turned abusive without second thought), my free time, my career, my 2 master's degrees that I got debt-free, my body without stretch marks, money, extra time, extra resources, money, freedom, babysitting and only getting the good parts of parenting, that I've lived in 5 states in the last 10 years, traveling. 

I'm 35f and married. My mind didn't change when I turned 30, when I "met the right guy," when I bought a house, or any of the other milestones they said it would. I feel immensely fortunate that I knew what I wanted and achieved it. Having kids is a gamble that you can't undo, and I didn't want to take that risk. I'm grateful every day when I see the lives of my peers that seem tired and overworked. I have a chronic, but well managed, illness. It's not giving me issues now, but has in the past. On the days when I was SO sick all I could do was crawl between the bathroom and the bedroom and the thought of taking my dog outside the door to pee was almost impossible to manage; those were the days that I was SO thankful that I didn't have kids to care for. I don't know how people do it when they are ill, especially seriously ill. Getting a full 7-8hrs of sleep most nights and not having to hear crying.http://redditp.com/r/nsfw+gonewild+boobies+legalteens+realgirls+ass+amateur+ginger+nsfw2+voluptuous+milf+celebs+redheads+girlswithglasses+collegesluts+blowjobs+passionx+bondage+scenegirls+girlskissing+upskirt+dirtysmall+girlsinyogapants+hotchickswithtattoos+nsfw_wallpapers+nipples+asianhotties+o_faces+beach+snowgirls+gloryhole+highheels+cumshot+thighhighs+volleyballgirls+blondes+pigtails+latinas+pinkshoes+tanlines+brickhouse+panties+gothsluts+pornstars+smokin+buttsex+cleavage+mandingo+cumfetish+models+pics_nsfw+analporn+datass+ass_cleavage+bikinibridge+girlsflashing+orgasms+nsfwoutfits+lingerie+PetiteGoneWild+funsized+xsmallgirls+GWNerdy+jilling+rule34+asstastic+facedownassup+BubbleButts+videogamebabes+videogamebabes+cumsluts+GirlsFinishingTheJob+Annoyedtobenude+braceface+cfnf+femalepov+forcedorgasms+gingerpuss+girlsplayingsports+fuxtaposition+HappyEmbarrassedGirls+PublicFlashing+shewantstofuck+StealthVibes+TinyTits+Unashamed+Bottomless_Vixens+boyshorts+camwhores+CollegeAmateurs+creampies+datgap+datgrip+FestivalSluts+Fingering+FTVgirls+happygaps+LaundryDay+LipsThatGrip+NotSafeForNature+NSFW_nospam+pokies+primes+pussy+realbikinis+skinnytail+skivvies+TightShorts+treatemright+undies+WtSSTaDaMiT+xart+YogaPants+AmateurArchives+anal+asshole+boltedontits+burstingout+tits+bustypetite+celebnsfw+changingrooms+gwcouples+iwanttofuckher+lesbians+nobsnsfw+onoff+porn+randomsexiness+fuckyeahsexyteens+JiggleFuck+AsiansGoneWild+holdthemoan+WatchItForThePlot+CandidFashionPolice+GoneMild+tightdresses+BigBoobsGW+workgonewild+fitgirls+altgonewild+porninfifteenseconds+wifesharing+nsfwhardcore+palegirls+TittyDrop+juicyasians+suicidegirls+kpopfap+lesbian_pov+MoxiiAndFriends+SoFuckable+Cumonin+trashyboners+slutsbedrunk+russiangirls+SexiestPetites+snapchat_sluts+cosplaygirls+CosplayBoobs+SocialMediaSluts+sheerpantiesBasically a remote control that can take me back to any sexual encounter I've already had in my life so I could relive it and then pop back to the current time. Lots of good memories that would be worth reliving, to be sure.Full body contact. 
My SO gave me a massage while I was laying down and sometimes during the massage she would basically lay down on my back so her entire front side was in contact with my back side. I don't know why I liked this so much; it was a very connective feeling, just body on body. Even during sex I like it, I mean yeah I defiantly like the penis in a vagina part but when our bodies are in a lot of contact like that, it's one of the best feelings ever.

Been listening to this song on repeat for quite a whileTold them I had a buddy who worked at the same company.  They then said they didn't want to hire me incase it would slow down work, even though I was applying to a different department.It would be a hole the size of the laser, and that's about it.

The immediate area would be cauterized, and if the laser is powerful enough to go through the body (and assuming the body is stationary), the the laser would vaporize the body where it's passing through.  There would be a laser sized cylinder where the laser used to be.

Of course, the other considerations is continued laser versus a body piercing 'shot', and again, whether the body in question is stationary, completely, or moving about, how powerful the laser is, what wavelength of light used with the laser, how coherent the beam, how flammable the materials are, what their energy (nee heat) absorption is, etc, ad nauseum.

But all things equal?  Just a hole.

Fuck you Cyre Marc Maron.Trump. StevenOP a few minutes ago thinking about posting this questionI'd go with the Tea Party atmI knew a girl who legitimately believed it was a way for animals that knew they had shitty genes to not pass them along. Yes, she seriously believed that all gay people carry, and I fucking quote, "retard genes."I've honestly been asked if I was molested by some guy when I was a kid, as if that would explain my homosexuality. First off, no, I wasn't. Secondly, why would being sexually abused by a man make me want to be with a man? Wouldn't it influence a strong distrust? Isn't that why there's a common criticism of anti-men butch lesbians? "Oh they were hurt by a man/raped by a man so now they hate all men!" That's quite a disconnect there. Trauma makes you hate men if you're a lesbian, but makes you love cock if you're a man... hmmm. I am so old that college Psychology 101 taught it was caused by maternal anxiety, with statistics to back it up.It's caused by the mother making contact with too much plastic.It's not really a weird theory but it's interesting. (Be prepared for some second-hand probably not fully accurately related science...)
I learned that basically women produce more of a certain hormone when they are pregnant with male fetuses to protect themselves from the unfamiliar hormones. The more sons they have, the better their body is at protecting itself and making more of that protective hormone. And whatever that hormone is, it's related to homosexuality. So basically the more older brothers a person a male has, the more likely they are to be homosexual. 

So I don't know if this is proven but I think it's a theory on homosexuality and I think it's super interesting. The field of evo psych put forward (and then later retracted) the theory that homosexual men are basically "meant to be uncles", like auxiliary dads, who of course are less likely to have children of their own. IIRC it was somehow more important to nieces than nephews, but I don't remember how.

For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst. Deuteronomy 25:11

When two men are fighting and the wife of one of them intervenes to drag her husband clear of his opponent, if she puts out her hand and catches hold of the man by his privates, you must cut off her hand and show her no mercy.

* Everyone else is frozen completely and not conscious. This includes animals.
* Physics works the same as it did before.
* This lasts for exactly 3,153,600,000 seconds from the freeze.
* You are completely alone in this.
* You can do whatever you want as long as you can actually do it.
* At the end everything will be reset to exactly the same as it was before.
* EXCEPT for items or objects you place in any given room within your own domicile.
* Electricity, gas and running water work in perpetuity during this time.
* The weather has its normal patterns with seasons still the same and the occasional storm or blizzards still occuring.
* You don't age during this and you cannot die. However, any injuries still are injuries; you just don't die from them.
* Food will never go bad or stale.take some amazing photos. 

close ups of grizzly bears anyone?Go to Hollywood, put on my steeltoe boots and kick some idiot actors in the nads.Wait, I'm confused.

If time is frozen, then how long is a century? How long is a second?I would read every book, In every library I could find. One hundred years of solitude IRLSteal everything I can get my grubby little hands on. Spend many years loafing around and breaking into grocery stores to steal some of that really fancy sandwich meat. Procrastinate all the cool shit like reading every book and teaching myself how to rebuild go-kart engines until like year 98 and do it all half-assed and rushed. Read a lot of books, play a lot of video games, catch up on a lot of TV shows. Explore EVERYWHERE. Cry because I couldn't play with my dog. Maybe rob a bank or five. Read tons and tons of books, play outside, pet all the frozen animals.One by one I would line everyone up in a human centipede.  **Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*I learned more, particularly about other religions and ancient cultures. Once you study enough different ones, you see the patterns emerge in each one, which some people see as evidence, but I see them as ways that societies kept people in line/explained strange phenomenons. I don't see that as a bad thing, but it's not something I put faith into.My Dad's a pastor. I grew up and realised that religion was a choice, and it wasn't one that made sense to me.I realized the source of my anxiety was Church. Also I started to question things within the church. A lot of it didn't make sense to me. I went through a lot of psychological stuff and I always wondered if there is a higher being why would it care about me. Anyways so once I stopped going, my anxiety/ocd calmed way down and I was finally able to reason. All of the things I did were rituals or things I did out of fear. I was raised Christian, but people didn't even behave like Christians leaving the crowded church parking lot. The mean nuns didn't behave like Christians. Some of the hateful/exclusive attitudes and beliefs weren't Christian. And the rules-- which were allegedly handed down by God-- were changing all the time.

If there was a God, this was God filtered by man and had no bearing on the actual entity.

Grow up a bit more and learn the core message of Catholicism isn't "YOU'RE GOING TO HELL, YOU BETTER REPENT," but "You couldn't go to hell even if you tried if you truly believe in Jesus." Which means rapey serial killers who believe in Jesus go to heaven but saintly Jews, Muslims and Buddhists go to hell.

This made all kinds of no sense.

But the first seeds were mean nuns and selfish fellow church-goers.Grew up, discovered Catholicism is not universal (I thought everyone on the planet was a Roman Catholic) and you can in fact opt out of it, started questioning, realised that at a personal level I just can't justify believing in God/being part of the church as an institution, and continued with my life as an atheist. I grew up with a very Christian mom. She forced me to read the bible and be very "in touch" with God. I got curious one day when I was about 12/13 and began indulging myself in some really graphic, violent material. Then a family friend who was two years older than me whom I known for years raped me on and off for an entire year when I was 13-14 years old. Losing my innocence that young made me question that God was not something that was going to save me.Went to church with siblings and my mum but my dad never went. When I was about 8 I asked him and he told it was because he didn't believe in it. Something clicked.

Told my mum I didn't wanna go anymore, and she told me I had to go. Dad said I didn't. Mum and dad had an argument, and I ended up staying at home with my dad. My first Sunday at home my dad pulled out a copy of The Terminator that he'd recorded from the TV the night before, and we watched that together with him explaining the story to me.Stopped going to church as soon as it was my decision, mainly because it was boring. Went to uni, at some point realised fairy tales were bullshit, science made sense, didn't look back. I stopped going to church when I got my own apartment and realized that I didn't feel bad about not going. Then I realized I never believed in the first place I just went because it was expected of me.I don't consider the transition "losing" faith when it was misplaced in the beginning. To me it's more like gaining a more realistic understanding of the world. I was raised a Christian where the fear of hell and the devil was ingrained in me since I was a child. In high school, my older sister who I'm very close to, stopped attending church and started to tell me about her perspective, thoughts, and put enough doubt into religion and my own faith. It spawned a whole existential crisis for me at 16 and I was in limbo between being an Agnostic and an Atheist. I think I can say that I've come to terms with no longer being religious today but looking back, that period of time when I started to question and doubt and lose my faith and transition from being religious to not was definitely very scary and not easy. I blamed everything on my older sister for robbing me of my comfort and safety and now that I struggle with death anxiety as an adult and cynicism from learning about the cruel things people can get away with doing on this earth, I really wish I still believed in heaven and hell. When I was in 3rd and 4th grade, I attended a Christian private school. I was always a joker, but I got notorious fast in this school where most of them had been since day 1 of kindergarten. I was in trouble every other day, if not *every* day, and got sent to the headmaster pretty much every day too.

Unfortunately for troublemaker me, my parents had signed off on a consent form allowing the headmaster to paddle me. So, every day, the headmaster would lean me over a chair, recite a prayer, end it with, "In Jesus' name we pray - Amen," and then lay into me with a wooden, goddamn ventilated paddle. After years of that, I knew exactly how I felt about religion. Talk about negative reinforcement - might as well hit me with electroshock whenever I heard those words.

Of course, at age 24, I've since thought much more in-depth on the topic of theism, and I stand on a platform of much more than just, "It hurts."I was told god hated gay people, so i figured why keep up a one way relationship.Stopped going to church, took science class.The 2008 election. Seriously. I was a Christian before it and I finally saw how these monsters were using religion as a weapon. The so called Christians on the right were terrible people and I realized I did not want to associate with that behavior. So for the first time i finally questioned things and realized we don't know anything so why act like it. As a kid I went to church 3 times a week all the way through High School. I was at VBS summers as a kid too. I babysat in the church nursery. It was a baptist church. 

The church actually kinda set up the start of it for me. The pastor and my parents (mostly dad, the most evil person I ever met) were always talking about what was evil and what we should avoid. Metallica. Ozzy Ozbourne. Crowley. And the actual antichrist himself Salman Rushdie. When my little brother started buying Mettalica albums I was literally scared for his soul. Man, what s fucked up time to be in my head. 

I think the absurdity of this particular less than holy pastor (he was later caught schtooping a married churchgoer) set me up for inquiry and eventual freedom.   

I was on a navy ship for 6 months and read the whole bible front to back. Turns out I didn't think it was a "good book".  

The bottom line is that when I took for face value from people I trusted I was fed some pretty crazy stuff.  As I started to really just think for myself it was pretty easily clear. 

For many years after the revelation I was an angry bitter atheist. I got uptight and uncomfortable around religious folks and didn't mind telling them what was what in very frank terms. I'm a bit more mature now and realize that's just as bad as anything you find about the war on Christians on Fox News. 

I hope you find what you're looking for. 



I taught Bible class on Sunday for a youth group. Naturally, one have to read the material in order to prepare for class. The more I read the more questions I have (with no satisfactory answers). I finally come to a realization that I can live a moral and spiritual life with out religion. The best part was I get to decide what's moral and spiritual to me.I was raised to be very catholic. We would go to church every day, confess every week. I got pregnant with my son and I prayed every single day for a healthy kid, I prayed for a safe delivery and for everything to go well. 

I had the worse birth ever, where I almost lost him and where I hemorrhaged after a c-section and I was hit with postpartum depression really really badly where I didn't even want to take care of my son. I just slowly realized how if there was a God he wouldn't allow people to have kids to anyone, specially not if he was our father. He wouldn't put his kids through this pain. I slowly stopped believing until I just... didn't believe anymore. 

So yeah, having a kid made me realize that God wouldn't be allowing anyone who has sex to possibly have a child. Moved from my home town, now church seems to be more of cult. I was losing my connection with the church before though. It was when a woman was asking people to sign up against gay rights I was put off. Frankly, I read the Bible. I was a very religious altar boy and believed in the stuff I was taught in church and sunday school. I beleived that Christianity was about loving those around you and being a kind person. But I felt that I wasnt being a great Christian because I had never really read more than a few pages from the Bible and I decided to read it cover to cover. I did and I was shocked. The Bible did not contain the messages I had expected. Instead it was full of arbitrary rules about shellfish and fabric blends, it told stories of massacres and genocide committed by god or his champions, it demonized women, gays and foreigners, it was also nonsensical and contradictory at times. I realized that the Christiany I had grown up with was a culture based not upon the Bible. The good Christiany that is about love and helping one another is a culture that survives because they don't read the Bible. Those Christians are good people despite what the Bible tells them. They don't stone, murder or torture like the Bible commands them. They help because they have human compassion but mistakenly think that the Bible supports that behaviour. So I guess that sums it up. I read the Bible and it convinced me that the Christian god is made up and if he isn't he is a demon and not a good person. Started studying theology religiously.To make a long story short, I slowly realized all of my reasons for believing weren't very good.

To make a short story longer, I realized that the god my family talked about, the god they talked about in church, and the god described in the bible didn't really seem like the same guy. I wanted to know which one had it right, so I did some research and asked people about it. 

That didn't get me much of anywhere, so I tried to ask god to sort it out for me so I'd know what he wanted me to do. I never heard anything back. That didn't immediately turn me into an atheist or anything, but it forced me to look at things from a new perspective.The internet taught me. Having had a lot of internet time once I was out of college, I was converted within a couple years.I just grew up. Common sense told me it was all a crock in my opinion.Became friends with a guy that was gay. Turned out he wasn't the evil, soul destroying monster I was taught. Started rationally analyzing everything I had been taught and quickly realized it was all wrong. Looked into other religions and found all the same BS.I'm gay, and many told me that I'm an abomination. So I began to read up on atheism, and it made much more sense.  I realized that either all of them are right (which is impossible) or none of them are (which is true.)My parents divorced, and at seventeen i was slapped in the face with the reality that this perfect world where God loves us and everything will be ok if you have faith is bullshit. I was raised in a sheltered box going to christian schools and very heavily in church. I'm a depressed and bitter adult. Working on it though. Back in 8th grade both my grandfather and mother were in the hospital with some serious health problems. I went to a private Lutheran school at the time and our interim pastor visited us. What we thought was a kind gesture turned into a lecture on the importance of going to church. He said my mom's blood clots were a sign from God he wants us back in church. I decided that day that I wanted nothing more to do with religion. It didn't make sense, if an all loving God exist why would he send you to hell if you made a couple bad mistakes, then I started realizing it's just a thing people do because they're scared of what will happen to them after they die so I've decided to stop worrying about dying and start making the most out of my lifeI realized how many priests avuse children..If god was real would he allow this?I lost intrest in caring anymore about believing in a god. Even if she/he/it did existed, I wouldn't care that much.I was raised in a Catholic but not really practising household. I remember knowing that there were many different religions, which made me wonder who of all those people were right, but we didn't really discuss religion at home. We did discuss science a lot (as far as a small kid can discuss science with their parents). My first real contact with religion was at age 8. After a serious incident in my school I was transferred in the middle of the school year into a parrochial school. I clearly remember a teacher asking us, in a serious tone, why we hadn't gone to mass on Sunday. Children aged 8. With zero chance of going to church unless their parents took them. That was the first of a series of guilt inducing, hypocritical events that made me split from the church as an institution. I still had some faith though.

It wasn't until I was out of high school and started mixing with other kinds of people that I began to question things more. I noticed that everything I had been taught was about fear of punishment or expectation of rewards. The motivation to be kind to others, to do good, to put it simply, was avoiding hell / earning heaven. That didn't go well with me. I also started to have a more honest relationship with my dad, who considers himself an agnostic. Learning about all the crap religion in general has brought into the world played a big part, too.When I was younger I always despised church and that prompted me to find reasons to question my current religion, so as to find a way out. I ended up finding so many questions it couldn't answer, and reasons why a Godless universe just makes sense. I had my edgy phase in 10th grade where I'd go after super religious people and try to upset them, but I got over that eventually.None of these experiences so far are about losing faith.  They are almost universally about recognizing dogma for what it is and beginning to reason independently.I realized that a lot of it was psychologically manipulative and only functional within the microcosm of the Church.  Also realized that the general doctrines of the church can be lived without the pomp and circumstance.  I still call myself a Southern Baptist because that's how I was raised, but I haven't attended church in years.I was raised in a Catholic family. When I was a kid the church things were awfully boring to me so I avoided them whenever I could.

However, the biggest change came with education. People all around the world worship so many different Gods and deities and I didn't understand why "my" (Christian) God was "the right one". Also, my family, especially my grandma is always bashing Muslims, Buddhists or even Evangelicals. But I couldn't see the reason for all the hate. Those people believe in something else, so what?

Since then I grew more tolerant of other people's religious views than ever. I love the diversity. So now I'm like a distant observer, watching but not getting involved.
I grew up in a very Christian household. As a teenager, I lost faith mostly for rebellious reasons. I had a brief (but very intense) resurgence of faith in freshman year of college. I legit read religious stuff for 8+ hours a day, sometimes. 

One of the things that started to get me out of that phase was that I couldn't bring myself to think of God as loving or caring. All I saw was that he thinks I'm so vile that I should go to hell for all eternity, and that he only spares me because of something his son did. 

Then I started to think about how prayer works (or doesn't). And I realized that if I prayed for something according to God's will, it would have happened anyway. And if I didn't pray according to his will, it wouldn't happen anyway. And then I started thinking about how millions of children are starving around the world, and if he won't do anything about them, why would he care about my problems, which are much less severe in comparison?

Then I started looking into actual evidence for God's existence, and I honestly just didn't think that any of them were compelling enough to justify belief. I read books on where the Bible came from and how the canon was chosen. And I eventually just stopped believing entirely, and have been an atheist ever since.When you spend your 16th birthday on the phone with the hospital okaying risky procedures for your mom in the ICU. Then you pray as hard as you can for her to be there the next morning. I've always been questioning the existence of God before then. Maybe if I prayed hard enough it meant he was real. Then the next morning you go after she's stabilized, but she dies while you're on the way to the hospital. Then people tell you it happened because everything happens for a reason, she's in heaven now, blah blah blah. No, things happen because the world is a cold, dark place. I know the doctors did the best they could. Sometimes people die. My version of "God" the helps me are my close friends. Don't need anyone else. I took biology and it made more sense. I've read the bible 4 times, when I was in my late teens I wanted to go to seminary school and almost did.  I continued to believe well into my thirties, strongly.  My wife is a Buddhist, and we just agreed to disagree about religion, I have always understood why people didn't believe and never pushed my religion on them.  One of my biggest struggles was always other Christians, why are they all so cunty, and intolerant ( I live in the south)...  And then one day I literally, "wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense, if god is omnipotent, why do babies get cancer? Why is there so much suffering?"  And, well that was that.  It's not that I don't believe any more, its just that I don't know.  And I don't think that anyone knows.  There may be a god, but I doubt that one of the worlds newest religions has it all figured out.  Oddly enough, the further I move from religion, the more pro life I become.  To me its just logical. TLDR: If the bible was a movie it would have many plot holes.

A few things mainly.  First event was when I was about 10 in parochial school where we had to go to church for some classes.  The priest (who was a great guy) was explaining the idea of something called Original Sin.  That all humans are born with sin and thats ok but its unavoidable.  I was a ballbuster as a kid so I asked him if that would apply to a newborn baby who dies.  He said yes.  So a newborn baby that dies and did not have enough time to know about Christianity and basically had an empty slate besides original sin, wouldn't they go to hell? He said God is in all of us even babies and that just screamed bullshit to me because of all the non Christian babies out there.

The second event came when we learned about Lucifer.  Basically what I got from the way he explained it (and no I did not research these things after so maybe this isn't accurate) was that Lucifer was a really good guy.  He was God's best angel and became angry that God loves humans more than he loved the angels so God banished him to hell.  Little kid me was like WTF thats an overreaction and I felt kinda bad for Lucifer and I thought I would be upset too if I were him. 

Number three.  All of my priests told me pets don't go to heaven.  Fuck that.

Four and final one I'll mention atm to avoid a 500 page comment.  He was explaining how large Christianity was and how many people worshipped it when we learned about the Great Schism. He said there were over 20,000 different sects of Christianity that all disagree on a few things starting from that event.  Thats just stupid.   When I was 13 one of my teachers mentioned how many religions there are in the world when we had to do a theology paper and he was asking us how is it fair that out of all of these we are right? Everyone else is wrong we go to heaven.  Idk lol many straws broke that camels back for me.  Religion is shit and should be destroyed.  Faith is great and I think it is important to give to kids.  /End rantRaised a Christian. When I realized that Christians and other religious people were more evil than anyone, and that they only used God to justify their evil.

If there is a god, it protects the strong and the wealthy and the cruel people of the world. It kicks the poor in the teeth and does nothing to help them.

Why would anyone worship a sadistic asshole? But then, that sadistic asshole is merely a human creation designed to manipulate and scare people into doing what unethical "leaders" want them to do. 

There is no god. We are all we have, and we suck, too.For me, it was my family's serious homophobia due to their religios beliefs. 

When my cousin came out as gay, my family told him that he was just confused. When he brought his boyfriend to the house, my grandmother kicked them both out so she didn't have "sinful" people under her roof. 

When I came out as bisexual, my mother told me I'd better get my head on straight because God would send me to hell if I slept with another girl. 

When my uncle's wife left him, my uncle began dating a guy he'd been close with since high school. My grandmother caught wind of it, and my uncle and his partner were banned from all family events.

I know not all Christians are like this. Most are actually incredibly excepting of the LGBTQ community. But not my family. I just can't bring myself to become a Christian again, because of how it was growing up in a family that told me god hated me. Lost my faith with 14 years. I wasn't religious in a traditional way (didn't go to church, didn't know any prayers etc.) but I did thank god every night before sleeping and I have done this for couple of years.
With puberty I started to get interested in "how fucked up is the world" (watching documentaries about wars, massacres etc.).
With 14: The mother of my best friend finally lost the battle to cancer after an agonizing, long and slow struggle with death and the father of another good friend died.

I think the painful death of those two persons I knew, together with the "knowledge" what atrocities are happening in this world led to my struggle and then I started asking myself "how can anyone let all this happen?"
For me I answered it with "Ok, maybe there is something almighty, but that is not something I want to whorship as it clearly doesn't give a f*** about people". Stopped my prayers, didn't attend church (funerals etc. excluded) and I am at peace with that subject.Was raised in Hindu family in India. Was surrounded by Muslims, Christians and Sikhs all through my childhood. I used to wonder why some are vegetarians while others rather enjoy their meat. 

Many other such questions about prevalent polygamy in Muslim but not in Hindu. Hindu says Brahma created the world, Muslim said Allah, Christians had their 6th day theory. 

I was always agnostic. When you are surrounded by so many conflicting theories of our existence, most of which cant be proved, you are never confident of your choice. Rather than choosing a religion and facing this conflict in my mind everyday, i decided to ditch it all together. I believe that their is probably some supreme soul who created all this, but he gave us free will, he didn't bind us in some rules to follow. The rules were made by humans to create a better harmonious society and the fear of gods wrath acted as a tool to achieve this. These believers established religion to pass on this trend. I don't believe in any religion now. But i am doubtful about existence of god.TL;DR: I didn't necessarily lose faith in *a* god as much as I lost faith in the "faithful people" worshiping him.

I was raised Christian, then catholic, and I love the education I got from my childhood, it was much better than the public schools around me. Going to church was never a choice to me, it was required, so up until I left the house, I went to church because I had to. Once I left though, I immediately stopped going because I didn't like it, it had no purpose to me. I did end up going back once or twice, but never to much avail. Luckily, I went to a private, Jesuit university that we had to learn about religion in. Initially, I didn't like it, but I started to learn about the catholic faith that I supposedly grew up in, and it amazed me how my childhood church was nothing like the teachings we were supposed to be taught. We learned a lot about Catholicism, and some about Islam and Judaism, and it all stuck me as similar, if not the same.

This is when I realized I truly wasn't religious, it's all the same story told by different people. It *logically* doesn't make sense, and I'm a logical person. The systematic suppression of people that don't think the way that one group of people thinks, is not at all what these "teachings" say, it's just how most believe to interpret. I'm speaking of mostly Catholicism here, since that's what I know most about, but it systematically represses every non-white male in some way or another, and still represses those who are white males if they don't agree. It isn't a belief, it's a large cult. 

The more I learned about it, the more I saw this hypocrisy within the people surrounding me. The lack of acceptance of ideas contrary to their own, as well as the same teachings for the past hundreds of years. I've learned that the suppression of groups never went away, it just goes from one group to another, and that religion and the *word of god* is the cause of this. 

I can't believe in something that has no basis, something that can discriminate so well for so long, it doesn't make sense to me. I am not so much an atheist, but more of agnostic that believe that if there truly is a god, whether it be Allah, Jesus, God, or Budda, that they simply want us to live moral, good lives. They want us to treat everyone equally, regardless of their stature, and that if there truly is a time of judgment, as most religions predict, that it won't be those that have contributed the most money to the church, it won't be those that have died in the name of their god, it won't be those that have held high ranking positions in their respective churches that get saved or spared, it will be those people that simply lived a good life and helped out when they could out of the kindness of their hearts.

I'm not sure a god exists, but if he does I don't think he wants us to be assholes to other people because they believe something else. I lost my belief when I realized this is not what a church wants you to believe.Well I lost my faith when my grandfather died, since he was a priest in his early years I couldn't understand how he could get cancer twice and die just like that. 

Pretty terrible logic but hey 12yr old kids think up weird shit right? As such I haven't been in a church since its been 11 years. As I spent more time online and began listening to people with different views,  as well as learning more science and watching lectures by people like Neil degrasse Tyson and Richard Dawkins, I began to question things. But oddly enough, the straw that broke the camel's back for me was Twitch Plays Pokemon. Seeing a religion created in front of me made me realize how easy it was and that The Church of the Helix Fossil had just as much proof as Christianity, very little to none.Reading the Bible. I shit you not. Jesus' own words are so out of place among all of the vengeance and smiting. I did not lose it. I asked it to leave. After much contemplation, reading and conversation. I arrived at nothing. And it is beautiful. I no longer have any questions. I subscribe to nothing. Not any ism. I just am. I just got lucky. Pretty fucking cool. I was a hired as a caregiver at a home for developmentally disabled sex offenders. My first couple of days there were spent reading their case files, including details of their various crimes. I had the realization flash over me like a sudden lighting strike; there simply cannot be a divine being that allows for this level of barbarism. Fuck that place. Fuck those people. I wouldn't say I grew up in a super religious household, but it was something that was apart of my family's life. I was baptized, attend CCD, etc. but rarely went to church. I think that factor of not attending church regularly or caring much about catholicism eventually led to me questioning everything at 15 years old. I realized how wrong it was to force religion onto someone, especially a child. I was always scared of going to hell and scared that I was starting to not believe in god. My friends are religious and I even spilled to them about believing in evolution and disowning creationism. It just all started becoming fairy tales to me, and science just made more sense. Then morals come into play and realize that not supporting gay marriage because of my religion is just plain inhumane. Of course, I'm still 17 and in denial from time to time and I'm starting to accept the fact that I don't believe in god but haven't quite told my family."I have a dream"

It was the unanimous opinion of all ten of us that skiing is better than sex.

Most of us were 1%ers at the mountain where we skied.  I was proud of my ability and quietly competitive with anyone I skied with, but two of the best days of my life were the days my daughter and her younger brother each blew my doors off for the first time. Clean, cool sheets at the end of a long day. Making other people happy, whether it's friends or a loved one, when their face lights up because of you it's just the best feeling ever Having a person genuinely like you and want to spend time with you. It reaffirms that you might not be an awful personFinding something shortly after you have 'lost' it like your phone or wallet.

Dream Theater's The Count of Tuscany. [The Big Picture by Bright Eyes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp_fJ31tpkI) I feel like such a loser posting this, but I really enjoy this scene mixed with the song.My third leg.Right.My right leg, but mine isn't anxiety, it's a psychological condition from being prescribed a slight overdose of Ritalin over the course of 3 years...Right legI have no legs :cNot me, but my sister. 

She can snap one of her tendons in her hand over her knuckle. She'll place a coin on it and snap her tendon to flip the coin. And shit, it's a damn good coin flip. I have this hole in my back that expunges brown gooey stuff that smells. It's fuckin weird manI can dislocate my left shoulder on command. I can chirp in a way that sounds like a cricket.

I originally said I can chirp like a cricket, but then I figured some smartass would ask if I could do so by rubbing my legs together.My legs are unusually flexible.Ear rumbling. I can dilate my butthole on demandMy thumb can pop out of place. For example, if my hand was laying flat on a flat surface, like a table, my thumb can be pulled upwards, whilst other fingers remain on the table.
Not sure how well I explained it, but I can post a pic if people are interests enough.I can lick both elbows, dislocate both shoulders, and turn one foot 180 around. I can click my tongue REALLY loud. Once I went to do it and put my tongue under so much pressure the stringy thing on the underside snapped. I can still do it as loud but try not to because don't want broken string thingy again, it was quite sore..Produce insane amounts of methane gas, in proportion to how much cheese I have eaten. 

If the world goes Mad Max, I will be kept in a pen with pigs to fuel the Motors. But, free cheese! So not as nightmarish as one might think!I have very supple joints in my upper body. Many restraining locks except an arm bar wouldn't work on me.I can bring myself to orgasm without touching myself or moving any muscle except the ones in/around the vagina. Are those the kegels? Idk.If I flex my neck muscles really hard my head shakes rapidly and my face goes red.[deleted]Before my eye sight was fixed with laser surgery I always thought and was told my eyes were.around +3 both. Right before the surgery the surgeon used eye drops that relaxes the eyeballs and told me I had actually +4 on both eyes. Surgeon said young eyes work hard so it appears and works as +3 sight. (Non native speaker sorry.)I can vibrate my hand. My knees are double jointed so they go backwards like a dino.I can wiggle my ears. Also the ear rumbling thing. I can dislocate my jaw at will.Sometimes at night I pass out for no reason and don't regain consciousness until morning. I always wake up fine, but it's pretty scary sometimes.Ovulate whenever it bloody feels like it. It's period roulette, I tell you. I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will. I can make my right eye twitch and shake violently on command. I just like doing it when talking to people sometimes and see how long it takes for them to get uncomfortable. I can dislocate the middle toe on my right foot whenever I want.The triple clover with my tongue and push my chest/sternum out farther than anyone I know.Dislocate both shoulders and hips. Pop my wrist and move a tendon in my ankle (this ones an extra tendon apparently)I can spin my arms 365 degreesI can pop the knuckles in my hands repeatedly. It starts to hurt after half a dozen times or so though.I can click my throat in a way that it sounds like someone is playing plinkoI can make my ear squeakHa!

Can do pretty much every joint, including wrists and every segment in my fingers and thumbs.My right wrist constantly cracks whenever I rotate it. Every. Single. Time. It's great though whenever someone tells me they hate when people crack their bones. Can touch my tongue to my nose. If I hold my ear and push in and up, something in there pops. You can hear it several feet away in a quiet room. My hearing is fine.I can dislocate my jaw to accommodate a bigger bite out of my burger. And I can fart on command, similar to how someone can make themselves burp. Oh and i can't belch. If I do, I throw up.I can push my eyeball with my fingers and it makes a loud squeak.I can press my fingers flat against my palm.

I can curl my toes under my feet.

I'm at least 25% ape I assume, but I'm oddly not hairy.I get "eye bubbles" - little pockets of gas every once and a while that press on my eye until I wiggle it around and then they (quietly) fart out through my tear duct area.

No one I have mentioned this to has any idea what I am talking about.* I can pound a railroad spike through a 2x4 with my penis
Stay hard after cumming, then be able to  cum again.

SpaceNOTHING is constant EVERYTHING is changing, always.The fact that numbers don't stop and that the number line keeps going forever. RedditBasically any word. Just say it over and over again and suddenly they begin to sound very weird...Black holes My sister and me have this thing we can an "littler weird existencial awareness" and we call each other on that every now and then just to piss each other off. 

It goes like this: when we are in front of each other, she sees me and I see her. We are at the same time, at the same place, and have a different point of view. I don't see my own face, but she sees mine - and vice versa. For her, she is sitting with BornToBeWise at the living room, for example, and I'm sitting with *sister's name*. It's two points of view of the same situation that'll be craved on our minds, for moments or years, differently.

It's really weird when it happens, we poke each others faces and be like "YOU ARE SEEING MY FINGER APPROACH YOUR FACE". Probably doesn't make a lot of sense, but it gets weirder and weirder when we get our  "littler weird existencial awareness" time. 

Ps. we don't do drugs.I used to bag groceries and there was one old lady who couldn't remember what her car looked like, but she did remember her license plate number - so I had to carry the bags around the parking lot looking for KRP-482 - or whatever, until I remembered what she drove.

 She also would bring in a sack of empty cans and packages so she would know what she wanted to buy again. To this day I'm thankful she was too old to need to by tampons.

Of course, you'll likely have to pay more for the service.That if you are truly sick, and show physical undeniable signs, doctors will gladly work on you until they figure out what is wrong, because they are intrigued by challenges. Nope. They are overworked and just want to fix what they are familiar with. This apparently is just a huge gray area and most doctors don't want to keep working on someone that difficult. You will be pushed aside in most cases, and finding a good doctor for it is rare. BMW driver here. Turns out they actually DO have indicators. That everyone could be fixed if we only offered them enough compassion. But I've seen it not work too much to believe it any more. I'm sure there's something going on psychologically or neurologically that can be fixed, but I'm not convinced we know how yet.That all girls have nice boobies, sometimes that is not the case.That there's still hope for humanityhope for humanityAbraham Lincoln was a good person. That the bin Laden family members who were still in the U.S. just after 9/11 were flown out of the country during the no fly days.

Apparently the news just made that up."What matters is beauty on the *inside*."I made some giant water balloons as a kid with "special" balloons that my dad got from the drugstore.  Told all the kids at school about my discovery. Wasn't until much later on in life that I realized I was actually making water filled condom balloons. Brace yourself....you're about to be hit with a bunch of atheist comments....That I was specialI support the English football team Tottenham whose mascot is a cockerell. I'm currently 17 years old and up until I was 15, my dad made me believe that the reason the cockerell is the team's mascot is that a very long time ago one flew into Tottenham's stadium and scored a goal for them.

I felt like an idiot when I so assertively told my friends that it was true...That my parents wanted to have me.My mother had a very aggressive Jack Russell when I was young. He wound up biting my sister really hard and making her have to get stitches, so my mother told us that they'd given the dog away to someone who could take care of him properly.

When I was like twenty I happened to mention that dog to my sister and she was like "duh, you don't need to keep up that story anymore. She had him put down." Until that moment, it never even occurred to me that the dog didn't end up rehomed. Yep, both disc and digital.

Yes, because "good colleges" can translate into better jobs and higher wages, even between two people in the same industry.

No, because job interviewers aren't always looking for more knowledge base of your major. They look for more general skills, like teamwork, data analysis, communication. You could be an english major and end up working in finance. It's not just about book smarts. Depends on your chosen career path.Yes. You can get hired easier for what degrree you're aiming for and you can get a higher pay doing the same job.A stanford doctor will always beat a community college doctorIf you are smart, yes. If you go to a mediocre college your classes won't be challenging, companies will (rightly) assume your skills aren't as good, your friends won't be that smart, your network will be useless coming out of school and basically your career will be significantly below your high school classmates with similar intelligence.

If you're not smart, you might get a slightly better job from having gone to a good school but likely a combination of your interests, drive and abilities will keep you off the golden path anyway.The biggest deal is figuring out what direction you want your life to go before you invest a shitload of time and money.

It really depresses me to hear about families with abuse or hatred. Perfect? No. Healthy non abusive? Yes.0

"Perfectly healthy" is probably way different than "non-abusive." 

According to the CDC's page about the [ACE Study (Adverse Childhood Experiences),](http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/about.html) "Regardless of the data source, almost two-thirds of surveyed adults report at least one ACE, and more than one in five reported three or more ACEs." 

So if you think about ACEs as indicators familial health, most people experience some familial problems. And quite a few (but probably not the majority) experience major problems. 

I don't think Brady Bunch families are very common. I think familial conflict is very common and perhaps important- It's a very safe environment for people to learn conflict resolution where people usually forgive one another. 

Uh, but yeah, I come from a nightmare of family and grew up being abused and watching a lot of violence. It was mostly because of one mentally ill father.

I had one a long time ago where I was in a foster home with a bunch of other kids. Well one of them was a turtle kid. Had a shell and everything. Well I guess I snapped out of my dream state and started lucid dreaming. I think it was the turtle kid. Then I shot turtle kid...I remember all of them now. I started keeping a journal next to my bed. I remember them when I first wake up, then it fades. But now I can look back at my journal and remember exactly what it was about.Are these literal dreams?

At one point I lived in a very rural settlement with my dad. The previous owner of the land had left man-made trails with his ATV to his personal hunting cabins which he had abandoned later on when he could no longer afford the outer acres. In one dream, I had walked upon on such trail but instead of coming across the closest cabin, there was a window frame wedged between some branches. When I looked through the glass, I saw a hunting camp that seemed to be in disrepair. The window seemed to open on top of the sturdiest building. I climbed through and explored. I found a semi-feral dog at the camp, seemingly abandoned but anxious for company. I found an old ball and we played catch for hours until the sun started to set. I left that dream space and never returned.Dreamed that my mom was stabbing me once, dreamed that I got one of my female friends pregnant (that was weird, but she's kind of hot, so I don't feel bad about that one), dreamed I shit in the sink once.

I have a high pain tolerance (I once caused myself some issues by eating crunchy food the same day I got my wisdom teeth out) and I was very committed to a natural birth.  I was in labor for about six hours with no problem and then my water broke.  I made it like maaaaybe an hour after that before I wanted an epidural asap.  The pain is so exquisite, so all consuming.  You try to tell yourself that your own body isn't going to tear itself apart, that it only lasts about a minute and you can live through anything for a minute...and it is so awful that as soon as the contraction is over, you are in primal fear of the next one.  

As for what it feels like.  Have you ever swallowed to big a piece of tortilla chip, and it gets stuck in your throat?  And you can feel your esophagus contracting to move it down?

Recently, I found out that I would get a full ride to my first year of college, and because of that, I decided to take on another major (they're paying for it right?). I was talking to my mom and I said, "Well, now I only have to take as many classes as I can handle". That was the first time I'd really understood the weight it and it was incredibly calming. Considering the fact that I've always been just a dense ball of stress, it felt like I'd just taken heroin or something. My body completely relaxed. It was kind of mind blowing.

Also, bills, bills, bills, and not green-spendable kind. The red-debt kind.I don't get why "ass" is part of that phrase.I was 13 years old and talking to the mother and her 5~ year old son. I began to entertain him to give him company, stopped to say something to the mom, and the kid says "*HEY LADY!!!*"

I was out on a day-trip to the Folk museum with some of my extended family (The museum is a stretch of land made to look like a small village from a couple of hundred years ago, and there's working shops, houses and places you can explore. Pretty cool!) 

Anyway, I was messing around with the two youngest kids (8 and 10) and we were basically being mischievous as children are - going into restricted areas, pranking, etc.

We came across the Church building but it was completely empty. There was an area with a ladder and stuff, and it looked a bit sketchy.

I said to the kids, "I don't think we should be in here without adult supervision."

I've never even tried reading it because they piss me off so much.People are generally selfish on the inside. If it serves them to be good, they'll be good. If it serves them to be bad, they'll be bad.Unfortunately, after my life experiences, evil.Generally people aren't concerned with being particularly good or evil...inside they just wanna get by...we just notice particularly bad or good people cuz they stand out... If evil is the act of serving yourself over someone else, then I would have to say that humans are inherently evil.  What would you do if there were no negative consequences for your actions.  I think you would see some pretty awful actions.  This line of thinking somewhat proves itself with the multitude of class systems we have around the world.  

How people with higher social standing treat those of lower standing based on nothing more than to whom they were born.  On the flip side we are capable of great empathy.Good, it is just a matter of perspective. One mans good is another mans bad. I think that there are people who are self centered but nobody who is actually genuinely malicious. Even psychopaths only really kill people if it benefits them in some way, usually sexually or as a form of revenge or even if that person is getting in the way of them getting a promotion etc.People are neither good nor bad, but rather either tedious or charming. And in general, people are more tedious than charmingEvil, but that's only defined by societal conventions. People are people.I believe people are just people. Take that as you will.people are a type of animal with an over-inflated sense of ego so both and neither at the same damn timeI think everyone experiences the world through a different lens of what is okay and what isn't. In their own mind they are good as long as they keep to whatever values they hold, but their lens isn't necessarily the same as other people's. So good and evil is really just a difference of opinion. If everyone thinks they are good who gets to decide what's right? Low-level evil. Like, most of them would be about on a par with some random mook standing behind the main villain who you never see doing anything particularly evil, but hey, he works for a guy who wants to flatten Tokyo with a space-laser...We have the capacity for both good and evil and most people are okayish. Probably bad influence from the wrong friends.

I know a guy myself who has great parents, they live in a nice house etc., but was just an aggressive asshole, who was even treating his parents bad. And I think this was because he was friends with the wrong kind of people.Generally good natured, despite things like greed being ingrained in us, but I think we learn evil through life experiences. I think it's also getting worse the more we ignore mental health and then generally evil people have babies and they make them evil too.I believe people are generally good.  I have to, or I could not walk out the door in the morning.  There are evil people, but they are the minority.Everyone is born good. They become bad on the way. So people are generally good on the inside, you just have to brush off the dust.neutral. actions they witness will effect the outcomeI believe people are generally good, that's in our nature. No one's evil whem they are born.

What can turn people evil/bad is if they grow up in a poor environment with abuse, crime, war or something like that.

I believe that there are too many people who are higher up that have an invested interest in the continuing success of tobacco companies.

Best advice is to take them outside as often as possible and shout toilet when they are doing their business. Two days in and my puppy now understands what i mean when I say toilet outsides and has had only two wee's in the house so far.

If you've done it, I have no idea.To elaborate on this, it has already happened, two days ago a group of young men decided they were going to hunt down and kill a humpback from a pod that was migrating north; the area we live in is not part of the federally allowed hunting tribes; that is only a small portion of the natives here. 

its all over Facebook right now if anyone is curious. Alaskan Natives are allowed to kill, for sustenance reason, only bowhead and Gray whales, and under specific conditions and numbers.

I said yes.

Then she took off her watch.I was in a mostly Hispanic High School and had grown up my entire life under the poverty line. Mariana was one of the hottest girls in school, class President, Miss Popular BUT also in my math class.  I was 135 lbs dripping wet, a nerd who enjoyed school, with red hair and freckles. Long story short, I had no chance. I had been awkwardly flirting with her for two years at this point. We were studying for a math final as a group at a buddy's house. She lived down the street and when we finished I offered to give her a ride home (anything to have time alone to talk to her). She accepted. As we walked out the door of the house it dawns on me, "Holy hell! I drive a 10 year old Toyota MiniVan that is utterly beaten up (only vehicle my family owned)." 
In fact, on a date with another girl a few months earlier I had been utterly shamed when she almost refused to get in the passenger b/c she claimed the worn down upholstery must be "dirty." I'm mortified. I can't back out now b/c we've walked out the door and there sits the van.  Dejectedly I turn the key, open her door and refuse to make eye contact as two years of work go out the window.  She smiles at me, continues unfazed in the current conversation with me, literally leaps into the van and puts on her seat belt as she continues to look at me. I finally recover from shock and manage to close her door and make it to the other side without falling over and low and behold she leans over and unlocks the door! I drive her the 2 blocks to her house and she laughs and talks to me never once glancing at anything in the beaten up old van. I'm seriously holding back tears at this point.  I knew. I was 16 and I knew.  We've been married 12 years and have had five children. (Edited because I left out a critical component)Picked up a good sized log that must've weighed 30 pounds, hoisted it to her shoulder, and hurled it into the dying fire on our patio while in a nice dress and drunk off her ass, then sat back down next to me, dusted off her shoulder and took another sip of her wine. Respect. It wasn't just one thing in particular but a moment where everything just clicked and I stopped being afraid to admit to myself and to her I'd fallen in love with her and all the previous times I'd thought I'd fallen in love didn't even come close. 

I'd passed her by in the frozen food aisle of a grocery store she worked at and we smiled at each other. I barely shopped there and I'd never seen her before but she was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. Ten minutes later she was working the register and I picked her line. We talked for a moment but I had to leave because of other people behind me. I couldn't stop thinking about her though so I went back a few times until we had a moment alone and I told her I was taking her out to dinner. We exchanged numbers and talked pretty much all day and all night but could never meet because of her schedule. If I didn't see her at work it was almost like a LDR. 

Something like two weeks later she finally said this is ridiculous and she picks me up at two in the morning (my car was in the shop), and takes me to her house where we just talked until she had to go to work again. Turns out she lived just a few blocks away from me and we started living with each other. It felt comfortable but both of us were nervous as hell to say we loved each other. The closest we came was telling each other we were falling for each other. 

One night, late, she invites me out to meet her best friend. I go out and don't dance but just sat and watched her. She was mesmerizing (and an actual dancer as opposed to club dancing), and the only person in a sea of people I even noticed. It felt like a movie where everyone else is just a blur and she's the only one in focus. The song ended and she came up to me, leaned close and she whispered, "I'd be lying if I said I was just falling." I pulled her closer and told her "I love you too."

We got married six months after meeting each other and that warm Day One "when you know, you just know" feeling has never worn off in almost thirteen years. I doubt it ever will. She still takes my breath away, we still flirt, still go out on dates and still get flustered when one of us is especially sweet to the other though we say I love you to each other every day and mean it. There are times when we might get busy but pull each other aside and tell the other we haven't looked at each other enough. She's my best friend, the best and sweetest wife and she still feels like home.

We were crossing a train bridge over a small river. Old style train bridges are visually deceiving because it's very easy to see through the tracks and focus on the river below.

About a third of the way across she started to stiffen up. She'd focused through the trestles and onto the river. Instant mild freak out. I got her hand and she looked up at me. Those big puppy dog eyes were filled with a low grade panic that was gathering steam. I just said simply "I'll never let you fall." It was a weird, hanging moment we stared at each other. Then she said "Ever?" I said "Yeah, ever." She smiled at me and we crossed without a problem.

It was a strange rest of the hike until we got back to the car. It was awkward, maybe forced. I finally said "What was that back there on the tracks? Did I do something wrong?" She started to cry and I thought "Oh man, you fucked this up".

She said "You just watched me fall in love with you. I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for it to happen." We've never been apart since. Married over 20 years, 2 kids. I put her through college and she's a teacher now. 

I've never let her fall. 

**EDIT: OK, stop the inbox assault lol. Look, this was me before cancer, all fat and happy: http://imgur.com/c6IXPSX  and now this is me from a few days ago: http://imgur.com/95eRLAc  That's why I said I look like a troll, because the cancer rekt my face and body. I'm not down on myself, just realistic about what things are now. With cancer you better be honest with yourself or it's not going to go well.

That incredible lady held me through the entire thing and has never once wavered in her support. Kids, this is what you hope for in marriage. Life can be so very, very tough. Be with the right person and it will make ALL the difference.I brought home her favorite chips she grabbed them while saying "yoink" and ran into the other room.

She eventually realized we both lived in the same apartment and came back into the kitchen to share the chips. Heard her yelling "Arise, chicken! Arise!" while cooking dinner once. We were wrestling on the bed and I accidentally hit her jaw with my head. She ended up chipping her front teeth. It wasn't terrible, but noticeable. 

She laughed, tackled me into bed and we had sex. 

It was all over after that. It's the things she never did as much as the things she did.

She never put me down.  

Never once called me anything in anger, or said something to hurt me.

She never once betrayed my trust.

She never tried to change me.

She never chastised me.

She didn't fight when we disagreed, only debated.

She never acted jealous or immature.

She never gave up on me when I was being a problem.

The things she did were/are things I value.

She laughed with me.

She supported me.

She made sure *I* took care of *myself*... That's important to me, as I wasn't looking for a mommy figure to coddle me.

She went on adventures with me.

She cried to me.

She cared for me when I was sick.  

She helped raise my little sister, and is good to my dog.

She confided in me.

She became part of my family.

She tried things with me that were scary for her simply because she trusted me, even through tears.

She depended on me through devastating tragedy.

She proved that I could depend on her in the same.

She listened to me.

She advised me.

She doesn't just say she loves me, she tells me what she loves about me.

My wife is smart, sexy, talented, and loves me as much as I love her... Which is a shit ton of love.

We've been together for 17 years.  Pretty fucking awesome life so far.When I first met my wife she was telling someone that she had to have a small patch of skin removed from her forearm as it had been identified as being cancerous. 

I understandably said "gross" and she then proceeded to rub the affected area on my arm. 

I asked "did you just try and give me cancer?!"

We've been happily married for 6 years. 

She said she wanted me to be the father of her children AND despite everything I'd ever thought before that moment, I could see myself living that life and being happy living that life.

It's turned out better than I could have imagined.I'm not married, but we will be engaged within the next few months.

We were on a trip with some friends to New York City. We were in our bedroom in the AirBnB we were renting and we got into some stupid argument. I don't even remember what it was over. As it was getting heated, she said something along the lines of "I want to marry you one day!"

It just kind of slipped out. I just went "Really?" and she nodded. And I started thinking to myself, "You know what? I want to marry her, too."

Six months later, we took a trip to Southeast Asia. On our third day, she got violently ill. We cancelled our plans and I spent all day in a cheap Bangkok hotel bringing her water and cleaning up puke. At one point, she fell asleep and I looked at her and thought "Yeah. This is the girl I want to spend my life with. Violent vomit and all."I had just got home from work and she walked through the front door and it felt like the sun just walked through the door and warmed my entire body and I couldn't look away. Couldn't help but stare at her as she walked through the house. She asked why I was staring at he (she doesn't like being stared at) but I really couldn't help it. Never really could.It was gradual, no one moment but years of those things they do that make you smile. Met her through a common friend when  I was 17. Stood there like an idiot the whole time but finally asked her for her number before leaving. That was when I realized that it was the first time I had overcome my shyness and mustered up the courage to ask a girl for her number. First date, we had a lot of fun. She made me laugh. She was/is beautiful. It was around Christmas and we were talking about favorite Christmas movies. She told me her favorite Christmas movie was Die Hard. I knew right then. I love this woman One of the first dates we stayed in, ordered pizza, and played Super Mario All-Stars on SNES until the wee hours of the morning. 

That's when I knew. When I was playing on the neighbors yard during the summer going into high school. She had just moved two doors down from me with her family. She was going for a walk with her parents and I said to my friend, "I'm going to marry that girl someday". 

This was head over heels, love at first sight. So over the four years of high school, she kept turning me down. Fast forward to freshmen year of college. I was outside my dorm on the front steps and a car pulls up with three girls in it. They yelled out the window looking for directions to a different college. It was her. We hadn't talked for months and months before that. We've been together ever since. That was 12.5 years ago. 

Edit: changed heals to heels. I got her pregnant.The fact that throughout the 7 years I've known her I've had no issue imagining a long future with her, building a family, and doing all those mind-numbing, generic things regular people do. Previous to her I thought myself leading a freewheeling, cavalier lifestyle. She's changed me to the psychological core, so that's gotta count for something.After being married to my first wife for seven years, I knew within 30 minutes on our first date.  This is what it's supposed to be like.  Still great after 34 years.We went on a date to a nearby aquarium. I hadn't eaten all day because I was pretty nervous about the whole thing. We reached an area where they had these giant lobsters in these huge round tanks and we were looking at one that must have easily weighted 100 kg. Being famished all I could think of was eating this huge lobster and drenching it in garlic butter. It didn't feel right. They don't build aquariums to advertise sea food joints! As I was having this internal ethical debate she asks if I was hungry and if I would judge her if she suggested Red Lobster. I didn't judge her. We left immediately and had a fantastic lobster dinner. Drenched in garlic butter.She makes me a better man.  My husband said "when you broke that damn chicken". When we first moved in together, one of the only items I brought with me (he had a fully furnished home and my stuff was garbage) was this cheap, 10-much tall, chicken statue that way out front. For some odd reason, I was very attached to the chicken, and it became kind of a weird joke. A few weeks in we get into a horrid fight, mostly about me feeling like I was a guest instead of live in girlfriend. So, being completely irrational, I broke one of the only items I actually owned there, that damn chicken. I picked it up and smashed it into dozens and dozens of pieces. I left it on the porch and stormed off to bed. The next morning he was asleep on the couch, and on the table was my reconstructed chicken. He spent hours gluing and taping as much back together as possible, and although it was a visual eyesore (more so than it was, being a weird chicken statue and all) but I loved that damn thing. That was actually a defining moment for me, because who would go through all that trouble? I was shocked to learn that an episode of chicken rage was when he knew I was the one. But he said "as I was nearing the end of getting as much back together as I could, I thought 'i would not be doing this for any other person in the world. She is definitely the one.'" 3 months later he proposed, and we enloped in front of a gorgeous, old, train station about 6 months after that. Last week was our 4 year wedding anniversary, and we're going strong. Oh, and I promise I don't throw chickens anymore. I jumped in a pool with my clothes on at some party. I realized I still had my cigarettes in my pocket, effectively ruining them. She called me a dumbass and went to go get me another pack. We've been together for 10 years, married for 5, and smoke free for 1, expecting our first kiddo.Coming home from a fun weekend trip.  Didn't have a single disagreement or boring minute the entire trip.  Didn't want to drop her off at her place.  Asked her to move in on the freeway home.  Moved her in the next weekend.  Got married a year later.[deleted]Like /u/delibertine said. It isn't one thing. I was married for 8 years to a woman whom I thought I loved, then after the divorce and 4 years of really finding out who the fuck I was, I took a chance on a woman that I can only describe as 'having a glow'. I couldn't put my finger on what it was about her that drew me in, but there was something.

We immediately hit it off and she quickly became my best friend and my confidant. We created a day to celebrate our love for each other that we call "All Robes Day" where we never get out of our robes and just drink wine, eat fancy foods and swoon all day. It is a celebration of why we are together. Similarly, if we feel overwhelmed with life, we will spontaneously take a weekend out of town where we can concentrate on ourselves without the white noise of life. 

We are always there when one of us needed anything. She has seen me through bad, and vice versa. It is great. 

She wholly accepted my daughter and my dog into her life- and even more so does so in a way that is totally genuine.

I knew she was going to be my partner because the glow I saw around her when we first met, I still see. She is an unmatched spirit of love and compassion. 
There is some real Nicholas Sparks type shit going on in these comments and I have never felt more single in my life D:She threatened to commit suicide when I tried to break up with her and I'm still happily married to this day.  Wish^I^was^kidding
It was a self fulfilling prophecy. I went away to college and my mom said to me before I left that I would meet a nice girl at school and get married. For some reason she was convinced it would happen, and as soon as I went. Well, the second night of school my roommate introduced me to his girlfriend's roommate and that was it. A couple of years later and we were married. Moms always know. Just had my one year anniversary with the woman I've been with for 6 years. I honestly wouldn't have achieved what I have so far without her helping and pushing me. She goes out of her way to make me happy. 

To answer your question. There was a day that I was particularly upset, and she came over and was also upset. But she started acting happy, "because we can't both be upset. Then we'll never cheer up!"

She rocks.She doesn't it know it yet...a bit of a back story first. For some reason, I have always been amazing at recognizing people I have already met, however brief it might have been. I always remember their names too and seem to know more about them than they know about me...(mostly through others, or facebook, etc.) Its kind of weird...

Anyways, I started high school and I saw this girl that I recognized, but I just couldn't figure out where I knew her from. I became obsessed with her. Just the type of girl that you would almost want to avoid because you get so nervous around her...We had one night in grade 8 where we went to the same birthday party and we watched a movie in the birthday girl's basement. Her and I were sitting next to eachother and we held hands the entire movie. Nothing really happened after that, but I think we both never forgot that...after many years in high school, we went our separate ways, but I never forgot about her.

Last week, we bumped into eachother and spoke for a while. Turns out she had a big crush on me in high school and I obviously had a big crush on her. (She even distinctly remembered holding hands way back in grade 8!) Going out for drinks this week. All I need is one date with her and I am in guys. I know it!
 Shortly after my wife and I started dating she had to put her dog down which had been a part of their family for almost her entire life, and then my dad passed away. It was honestly probably the hardest two months of my life after that, but when we came out on the other side I looked at her completely different. I may not have realized it right then, but at that point a part of me knew she was the one. Fast forward a year and half and now I can happily call the wonderful woman who supported me through that tough time my wife. I am so lucky to find a partner like her, someone who I would give my life for, and someone who I know would do the same for me. I love you babuu, in case you happen to find this :) I'm not married, per se, but we've been together for 5 years now and I asked her to move in with me last year.

I was a broken person until my self-imposed re-awakening in 2013. She was pretty awesome yet I just didn't feel like I "deserved" her. Eventually this self-doubt early in our relationship led me to break things off so she could find someone who better deserved her greatness.

As I was breaking up with her I cried and could barely get the words out of my mouth without choking on the lump in my throat. She put her hand on mine and comforted me. She was more worried about my sadness than her own, even though she was crying too.

I realized I didn't want to lose out on this wonderful woman, so after a few days of thinking "What the hell am I doing??" and some more soulful conversations with her, I came to my senses and we've been together ever since.She invited me to her home for spaghetti with homemade sauce and meatballs. Then I knew.Good hatNot married yet but I plan on marrying my girlfriend. 

The fact that I can just be with her and enjoy everything about being with her. I don't feel like I have to think of shit to do with her, we can just enjoy being with each other and read. The fact that nothing really feels forced. Everything just feels natural. I just love being with her. We work well together. Even before we were dating we were really close friends. We could spend an entire day sitting around and watch heroes or digimon and just not move. We still can too. We can have conversations about stupid shit that no one else understands. She's sweet, compassionate, and just fun to be with. I've heard people say that a relationship should be like dating your best friend and I never really understood that until she and I started dating. When I'm with her I feel like I can actually be myself. It sounds like a cliche but it's true. I can be as stupid and fun loving as I want with her and I'm not judged for it other than the occasional "you're such a dork" with an eye roll and its the cutest damn thing. When I kiss her or hug her it's like time stands still and the world just spins. Literally everything is magic with her. I just love everything about her. 

I've had other girlfriends in the past but literally none of them have ever been like this. They might have felt real at the time but none of them have ever felt like this. It's like if you could see in 2D and that's what you assume everything is like but suddenly one day everything is in 3D and it's like...night and day. Everything feels different, new, exciting, and more real. I don't know if that makes any sense but that's the best way I can describe things. 

Before she and I started dating I thought marriage would just be more of the same and I sort of dreaded the thought. Now that I'm with her though I'm excited by the idea of spending my life with someone if it's her. 

I know I'm not exactly answering the question since I'm married but I guess I just wanted to throw in the perspective of before marriage when you're certain you've found someone who you want to spend your life with. 
The first time I met my wife was when we worked together at a job that we both briefly held at around the same time.  I was assigned third shift (nights) and she was assigned first shift (mornings).  I would see her for an hour when our shifts overlapped, and we would make small-talk about our similar interests.  The first conversation I ever had with her was about our mutual admiration for Steve Martin.  So, a few weeks later, when I had other opportunities present themselves, I submitted my resignation.  After I put in my notice, my schedule got switched around, and I was really worried that I wouldn't get an opportunity to see her again.  I remember telling a good friend that I had to ask this girl out on a date before I left or I would regret it for the rest of my life.  I ultimately decided to find a copy of Steve Martin's autobiography (*Born Standing Up*) and I took a card and wrote a message inside of it.  I explained how I really wanted to continue getting to know her, and provided ways for her to contact me if she wanted to ever get together again.  I wasn't assigned to work with her on my last day, and I remember going out of my way to deliver this book (and card) to her in the pouring rain.  Minutes later, I received a text on my phone.  She said she absolutely wanted to get together, and we agreed to have drinks a few weeks later.  We exchanged humorous texts back and forth in the meantime.  But on the day of our scheduled get-together, I received a strange text from her.  She couldn't meet me for drinks.  She still wanted to hang-out, but she asked if it could be at her apartment instead.  I told her that would be fine, and I visited her later that day.  She explained that the night before had been one of the worst nights of her entire life.  She had gone to a party, and on her way home, she was pulled over for expired plates.  However, she ended up getting arrested for a DUI and spent the entire night in jail.  She poured her heart out to me in her most vulnerable state of being.  I poured my heart out to hers.  Our first date wasn't casual conversation about Steve Martin over drinks.  It was us telling our life stories on her couch for hours and hours into the night.  Here she was, at one of the worst moments in her life, and I wasn't heading for the hills.  I could have walked away, but I didn't.  I not only stayed with her for as long as she needed, but I returned the next day so we could continue where we left off.  That's when she knew I was the one.  When did I know she was the one?  The first moment I saw her.  I knew I would regret it if I never asked her out on a date, and I'm so fortunate to have never lived with that regret.  We married a little over a year later, and we are celebrating our fourth anniversary this year.  She hasn't touched a drop of alcohol since the night of our "first date."  I've been with her through her entire recovery, and I always will be.It's a strange answer, but in my case I think I really became convinced she was the one about four years after we were married.

 She had been ill that year, both mentally and physically, which meant that she'd been in and out of hospital, and also that she'd been staying with her mother - a thousand miles away in a different country - who was looking after her during convalence. For four months, we barely saw each other and our telephone conversions were really difficult. I blamed myself, thought that maybe she was unhappy with me and wanted to run back to her mother. It was a low point. At one point I thought it was all over.

 Eventually she was well enough that I could fly out to see her. Almost s soon as I got there, she presented me with a sort of scrapbook in which she had written and stuck in little keepsakes from our relationship - tickets to things we went to together, little insider jokes between us, that sort of thing. 

Throughout the scrapbook there were also some really serious love letters, explaining what she had been going through, and saying how I was a support to her, not a hindrance. I was moved to tears. There was such love, such loyalty, such honesty. I fell in love with her all over again. I knew then that she was definitely the one. 

Since then - about six years ago - we've been a solid team. We learned to face challenges together, not to let them come between us. We learned to communicate much more effectively. Our sex life got a whole lot better.

It wasn't just that she gave me a scrapbook. It was what that represented. 
Her heart/values were evident through our conversations. She proved to be fun loving. We found similar interests. I knew she was the one after the first date.  We were at a busy college coffee shop.  We talked about silly stuff.  There was no awkward pauses.  We were completely focused on one another.  I had no other cares except worry that at some point the date would have to end.We were watching a movie in her bed.  She grabbed my arm and said: "This is mine now."  I said ok, and we watched the movie for another minute. Then she put her brand new hand on her boob.Never ran me off.I was leaving with my family on vacation. She and I had been having an ongoing argument for a while, and it bubbled over when I called her right before leaving. The call ended with her crying and hanging up on me. My dad - who **never** commented on any of my girlfriends - said "Son...that woman is a keeper."

Decided on vacation I couldn't live without her. Came back home, apologized, and told her I wanted to be with her forever. Got married 2 years later, and it's still going strong after 25 years. Kinky sex.Like many here it was a slow realization.  Butt stuff and laundry.  I can't do laundry.My wife was born in Russian and highly educated. She's an opera singer and concert pianist, needless to say I was impressed (nice ass, nice everything, too).

But what impressed me the most was that her English was better than most American girls and not only that, she got my very subtle, very dry wit and benevolent sarcasm. Plus she owns her own business and is totally self-sufficient financially.

We share almost nothing culturally (she was a Communist Party member in the USSR back in the day), but she is now a naturalized American and knows more about American current events, politics, society, culture, and economics than most Americans do.

I am a very lucky man to have found her at all.

She touched me on my pee pee. Stayed. My fianc would say it's when I had to help him after his ACL surgery and I let his heel down before he was ready to put it down so his leg bent. I ended up on the ground crying because I knew it hurt him. When she saw a 6'2" Conan O'brien like figure running around a Bavarian town wearing a two-sizes-too-small superman costume and thought "I can see myself with him"We had sex on a hot day and I left a sweaty skidmark on the sheets and she just laughed so hard.She asked me to marry her. I had no idea we had progressed to that stage in our relationship and wasn't going to say shit about it because it was going so well. I would have lived in sin with her forever, but three days later I put a ring on her finger and asked her in the old fashioned way, on one knee. We've been married almost 17 years now, together over twenty.She told meI've known my wife since 1st Grade. I used to chase her on the playground and tease her in class. I had a crush on her all through school but we dated other people here and there. But every now and then our paths would cross and crushes turned to love. We both had just ended really toxic relationships and spent a lot of time coping together and we realized how much we really needed each other. We were saying goodbye to each other one night and she leaned in and instead of a kiss she looked me in the eyes and said "I love you". I knew at that exact moment that i wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.There were indications all along but I didn't know for sure until she stopped a bunch of bullets in mid-air when three agents unloaded their clips at her.I see you saw the opposite askreddit post!Never married her; but "the one" (still to this day) matches me line for line in wit and even tops me.OP: what was it for you? I'm still waiting for that feeling... :(It was a series of things. For the most part, it was coming to the realization that I would rather have her in My life than not. It's probably a bit selfish because she could probably go out there and find someone better than me, but it's a selfish choice I made and I'm happy I did.When she'd use the word "cunt" without blinking, in a quaint English accent. /swoonI broke up with her while we were dating, and I couldn't figure out why I was miserable (my reasoning for breaking up with her were immature and stupid). I saw her at a play with some of our friends, and she completely ignored me. I saw my life without her, and it terrified me. I decided then that I would do whatever it took to win her back. I left the play early to make sure I could catch her afterwards. I found her walking out and begged her to give me 5 minutes. For some reason she found it in her heart to forgive me, and I began working to earn her trust back. Fast forward to almost 3 years of marriage. Life is hard, but I never want to go back!Dat ass.It's a small world after all.

Across from a U-haul rental place and dilapidated nail salons, and our apartment rent is $1350 a month. *AND* we're getting a friends and family discount since we're close with the landlord.Internet...fastest thing I can get is 3/1 DSL with a 150GB cap which I go over by a good bit. My bill runs from 52 bucks (base price) and Ive had it as high as 92 bucks on months I DL a lot.Caller ID. $5 a month just to see who's calling me. Some people believe some mental illnesses are fake. The attitude isn't usually about all mental illnesses. My stepfather believes that bipolar is just an excuse to get money from the government. He openly mocks people with it. Some people aren't the brightest and some people don't want to learn.Sadly I've met a few uneducated people who thought so.  I remember in high school that was a popular opinion too
Yes and they're all dumbdumbs. That doesn't even make sense. I can't speak for my entire family, but I have some family members who believe that it's just demon possession. Everything is demons to some of them. Power Rangers, Pokemon, CatDog, Cow and Chicken...basically any cartoon that isn't about Christianity is demonic. Check this shit out, my parents didn't care what cartoons I watched except for Ren and Stimpy, and that Sigfried and Roy cartoon that briefly aired on FOX, because they're gay.Great to hear some feedback, i was just simply curious because i grew up in a house hold where my mother had a PhD in counseling and had her own practice and recently had a conversation and the guy said he was amazed my mother mad a living off something thag wasnt real, ive never encountered someone who thought things such as bipolar, schizophrenia and such were fake and was caught off guard.I will probably get blasted for this but whatever..  
Define mental illness?  
The best we have is "different from the current majority". And even then it's fairly subjective. About 1 in 10 adults suffer from depression, is it a mental illness or just a part of who we are/our environment?  
A few extremes, sure, but the broad brush we've used to paint ever difference between us as needing labeled and corrected, I think is a mistake.  My high school prom was coming up, and my school was having a "promposal" contest. Of course, I had to win this. I wanted to ask a girl out with style, so I recorded a rap to ask one out and get the grand prize of free prom tickets. I wasn't exactly sure who I wanted to go with, and I didn't want to make a song for just one girl... fuck that; writing and producing a song is a lot of work, and if the girl says no then I did all that work for nothing. So I wrote out all the lyrics but left out the girl's name, making the song a sort of template of desperation. Long story short, I ended up asking out six different girls with my rap, each of them rejecting me. After that I just gave up, but I didn't want perfectly good rap lyrics go away, so [I still published a version of the rap with music video in which I asked myself out in drag.](https://youtu.be/uImnbCcY1Jo) I got third place in the competition, but since I didn't buy the tickets in time because I assumed I would win first (clearly), I ended up not going. In hindsight, this was *slightly* cringy.My friend once talked me into following two girls across a water park. For an entire day, we were basically stalking them whenever they went.Sitting alone at the sea for hours. Looked probably a little autistic. I still love doing this btwI made a chart (in, like, MS Paint), indicating how hot one of my friends is, compared to other guys.
He's a redditor, so he's probably reading this right now and facepalming.[deleted]I've probably done something creepier and forgotten about it, but what comes to mind is that I made an extensive MS Excel spreadsheet of my sexual partners, recorded items about looks, personality, behavior, sexual practices.  Then I created charts and some analyses to check to see if there were correlations between things like, for example, my subjective ratings of how crazy they seemed vs. how good in bed they were.  Not a statistically significant correlation on that one, as it turned out.Let myself into my neighbor's house when I was 13 and dog sitting for them while they were on a cruise.  Took all the MILF wife's panties out of her panty drawer, piled them up on the bed and had a week long jack-off-athon using their lube, a little red tube called Joy Jelly.  

When the week was up I took one of her pairs of panties home with me and used it as a jack rag for years.**Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

She's been with her agency for over 30 years and is eligible for retirement with them. She got a promotion about a year ago that has put her in a more stressful position and since then she has been talking about retirement. The agency is suffering some massive budget cuts this year and next, which means that a ton of staff have been let go and her team has been reduced from 17 people to about five, putting more pressure on her and making it more difficult to accomplish anything on time. I keep telling her that now is a good time to retire because things are only going to get worse in the near future. Her mom recently started radiation treatment for an abdominal tumor and retiring would give mom more flexibility to help take care of her, as she has been taking off work for over a month to be with her parents, and then coming home on weekends and trying to catch up on work at the office on Saturdays. I think mom is concerned about finding another job as a fifty-something, but she and dad have always been really good with money so I don't think they'd struggle, and I just started a full-time job with benefits that kick in in August, so she doesn't need to carry me on her insurance anymore.

Edit: As well as The Undertaker. Love him but too old already to be an active wrestler. He can't keep up. Abe VigodaUnfortunately I can no longer find the comment, but maybe six months ago someone made a comment on an AskReddit post about how they'd been diagnosed with Aspergers as an adult, then listed the main things that led them to look into it. I read the list and said "holy shit that's me". I brought it up to my therapist, who happens to have a number of Aspie patients, and she said "Yeah, I was actually going to bring that up soon." 

Now my wife and I can understand better why I have some of the preferences I have or do some of the things I do or think some of the things I think. It's probably very different from when a child is diagnosed, because a lot of the focus for an Aspie child is going to be on helping them get on in day to day life when they think about things differently than most, whereas I've spent 35 years faking it and have gotten good at that. For me, it gives me peace and helps me know that I'm not simply a defective or uncaring person, but rather that my brain actually works differently from most, and that's not something I need to cover up.

No diagnosis yet, and I'm still deciding whether I'll seek one officially or not, but both my therapist and my psychiatrist agree, which is enough for me for now.Reddit helps me to stay alive. I read stories and see people who also have problems but they decide to move on and that's the point why I will try to do the same.

Reading that now I get the idea this isn't exactly working positively but fuck it.I am even better at procrastinating nowI've made millions of invisible friends. =]I'm alone a lot. All the time, really. It's mostly my fault but oh well. Sometimes reddit is all I have. People on here I can talk to. Feel like I matter for just a little bit of time. It helps. I don't really have any friends or anything on reddit. I'm still thankful for everything. I know nobody is going to see this, deep down in this thread. But thanks reddit. You did it.Last year, I really passed through the lowest point of my life. I was unemployed and running out of money, living in a new city (that I didn't like) without my partner, friends, or family. I was so stressed and lonely, I didn't know how I was going to make it out. Being on reddit, specifically the subreddits of my most keen interests, kept me in touch with people and society. Sure, I could call or email my friends, but they had their own lives and issues didn't have much time for me.  I talked/video chatted with my SO every day, but that only did so much to alleviate the loneliness. Reddit was there 24/7, and there were people there willing to talk in intelligent ways about interests I didn't share with even people in my real life. I don't know how I would have made it through that horrible year without the distraction and connection afford me by the forums here. Gives me hope even though im struggling sometimes.Reddit is a fantastic source of porn :DBefore I got a smartphone and a laptop, I was occasionally alone with my thoughts. 

Phew. Glad that's over. I've learned a lot about sports, books I like, religion, politics, and other areas of interest to me.I have something to get me through a mind-numbing job of standing at a desk for 8 hours a day.I've gotten a decent amount of some redditor's favorite porn videos

And honesty it's hard to talk about in person. There are several subs on here that are full of people who know exactly what I went through/am going through. People who don't sugar coat it like people IRL try to. People who know what NOT to say. It's been super helpfulBy watching many assholes do stupid things and look like assholes on the internet.

My self-esteem is generally pretty bad so this made my week.Around 4 or so years ago, I got the heads up on r/freebies that Apple had a recall on the old style of iPod Nano and that Apple was replacing those recalled Nanos with new ones.

It certainly is a highlight of my 5 years of suffering through Depression, so there's that.Well... it turned me into a newt!Browsing AskReddit one day and reading comments from people with depression helped me finally get the motivation to go to my doctor and start sorting my life out. My depression isn't bad enough to consider harming myself, but combined with anxiety it's bad enough to stop me doing a lot of things just because I can't bring myself to do them, to the point where my life has pretty much been on hold for the past two years and I have to start uni from scratch. Should be back on track within a few months though, I'm proud of how well I'm doing now compared to last year.Learning english. Thank you redditors.It's helped me gain a sense of perspective on my views towards issues.It's made smoking weed better. Can't always expect things because there will be people to prove you wrong or work their hardest to prove their point. Also helps pass the time while you're in the bathroom I've been here since 2010.  For me, it's done the following:

* I have Asperger's and the /r/AskReddit threads on "what behaviors are super obnoxious?" and "what kinds of people do you hate?" have been hugely helpful in helping me be a more likable person.  I've definitely gained more friends since joining Reddit.  Similarly, I now notice a lot more social cues since Reddit made me aware of them.

* I'm the first person in my immediate family to go to grad school and /r/gradschool, along with the subreddit for my field were a huge help when I had no idea about how to go through the admissions process.  The subreddit for my field was also really good at exposing me to new and cutting-edge topics in it and helped me figure out exactly what I wanted to do.

* Taught me when a battle is just worth leaving alone.  There are so many fantastic shitposting opportunities on this website, and sometimes you have to realize that you aren't going to convince anyone that you're right.I have no real friends at the moment. I moved across the country after college, mostly socialized with coworkers, quit my job in january because it was burning me out in a million horrible ways, and now I got nothing. Made some feeble attempts to catch up with old coworkers but they're busy as fuck. I also live in one of the loneliest cities in the country, so it's really hard to make new friends or even acquaintances.

Some part of me is always saying "it's just a movie", and that's about it.

That being said, holy FUCK was I not prepared for *It's Such a Beautiful Day* by Don Hertzfeldt.

I saw it on Netflix and figured that the guy who did things like *Rejected* (You know, the cartoon banana with a spoon that was too big) and the interludes for the Animation Show would be anything but stupid absurdist comedy. 

The weird humour is there, but seriously, don't watch this one if you've got plans this weekend.

The film is incredible at telling a fairly simple story, and it's also visually very cool. I'm shocked it never gained much traction outside the indie film scene, or even a movie I've seen referenced on this site. 

If you want to be absolutely devastated by some poorly drawn stick figures in a one hour short film, I can't recommend it highly enough. Clannad, oh so many times in Clannad.

But they would basically be the exact same as everyone else just called their colors differently, also using the internet would confuse them seeing stuff like "why is lava red" It wouldn't make much a difference.

Daisy Ridley CANNOT ACT.Because they would be a hazard to pedestrians. It's better for society if cyclists die under a car than pedestrians under a cycleBecause you're a vehicle according to the law. You have to stop at stop signs and stop lights as well. You also have to use hand signals according to the law. Sidewalks are for people walking, jogging, or running. They're not for vehicles. Some bike lanes in my city are separated from the road, which is pretty nice but the reason why most places don't do that is because walkers tend to think it's for them even though there are clear markings. Its actually safer for both you and walkers for you to be on the road.Historically , because sidewalks were just for pedestrians , and roads were for horses and oxen and wagons. The bicycle was developed well before the automobile.Yes, I know the law in many places is written so bicycles either can or must use the road. That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking *why* did that come to be? Having cyclists use sidewalks *when available* seems like it would be safer. It seems to me that sidewalks are both used far less frequently than roads, and a collision between a pedestrian and a cyclist would be far less damaging to either compared to a collision between a car and a bicycle. And another thing, when they're making bike lanes, why don't they separate them physically from roads? Like use the grass strip between the road and the sidewalk to create the lane instead of putting it right next to several thousand pound vehicles moving many times faster.It's actually forbidden for cyclists over a certain age to use the sidewalks in many countries. Besides that cyclists can be very quick and sidewalks don't always have a good pavement, therefore the risk of potential accidents would be very high with them driving there. Because it's especially dangerous for people who are leaving a store if there aren't glass windows in the front of the store to see someone coming and it's impractical for everyone to look both ways before they open a door, especially in the cases of needing to escape a building quickly, say in case of a fire.

Plus, children ages 2-6 walk on sidewalks. At that age, kids have no idea to look around them for other things, even if they are holding a parent's hand. Children ages 2-6 aren't driving cars on the road. It is an interaction between adults. I think, if a bike hits a person and each party is injured on a pavement, it would be classed as an accident, similar to me walking into you on a foot path. A bicycle is not classed as a powered vehicle leaving a grey area when it comes to the highway code. If you wanted to sue me as a pedestrian, I would have to be on the road for any rules or regulations to count when it comes to blame. Does that make sense ?Wheels go on the road, feet that walk go on the side walk.Why can't drivers do better thinking about bicyclists as slow moving traffic? 

Keep in mind, I know most people are enraged by dildos who don't follow traffic laws where they live. What I'm asking is why we don't push for better integration (i.e. enforcing traffic laws for all traffic, including bicycles) rather than suggesting they don't belong on roads and should endanger people in wheelchairs, parents with strollers, the elderly, etc. when they're on the sidewalk where they belong.

This being said, I think that for obvious political reasons, Islam's threat to the West is being overplayed in Western media (I live in the West). Cheap, easy propaganda, because it's not like they pose *no* threat, especially since the states keeps kicking the hornets' nest. It's easy to exploit. 


I also believe that an unfortunate side effect of heavy political partisanship is that left leaning media often opts not to talk much about problems with Islam at all. As a leftist I think this is a problem, but can also understand not wanting to fuel this fire. For the most part the right wing media portrays nothing more than the worst kind of Islam. More and more the left wing seems to be trying to pretend Islam is harmless. It's portrayed as a lot *less* sinister than it really is.

Muslims are generally normal people, but the religious culture is sullenly conservative.I think it's given undue respect, by and large.  Most mainstream media outlets are extremely wary of being critical of Islam or its adherents, lest they attract the wrong kind of attention (viz: Charlie Hebdo, the Danish cartoons etc.)Islam isn't the problem, extremists are. Saying all Islamics are terrorists is like saying all Catholics are from Westboro Baptist Church. I've noticed a lot of talk about the dangers of radical Islam in the media lately, yet every Muslim I've met, whatever the branch of the religion, has been very respectful, friendly, and nice to me.  I think the biggest problem  comes when you're encouraged to generalize.  Doesn't matter the religion, people are varied and unique.  You have to treat each situation differently and you have to judge each person against themselves only.

God I miss being a kid.
Having no responsibility. Not being an adultMy family. We are all split apart now.That everywhere I turned there seemed to be something new and exciting. Adventures with friends were always the best, and yet nowadays fitting into a routine is the standard. Becoming used to things, knowing things... I remember when I was gonna be Spiderman.There was a field out back of my best friend's house.  It was all tall grass and blackberry bushes, and we used to spend hours building forts and picking berries from after breakfast until it was too dark to see.  I can't imagine kids nowadays doing anything like that.I realized I was dreaming and could control everything. I pondered what to do with this amazing power and the answer hit me. Root beer! So I conjured a root beer and it was delicious. But I wanted more. So I transformed into a fish in a pool of root beer and it was glorious. Then I woke up. My waifu in real lifeIn one of my favorite dreams I was in a hotel. I went to a high floor and after concentrating I was able to slip through the floors to get back down to the lobby.Last night, actually, I had a dream I was deep cleaning my car at a free vacuum place in my town. I needed to rinse a stain off a floor mat so I grabbed a hose and started to spray. Only, it wasn't a hose, it was a flamethrower. The stain was essentially burnt off my floor mat and I was like "well, it's out" and was pleased with my work.

Then, I became a girl in Pretty Little Liars and had to do P.E. with them and help them when they fell into another dimension.Crawling on top of the shelves in the supermarket to shop for items was totally normal.I pulled a piece of used gum off the bottom of a bench. It looked metallic but still soft like gum. I just popped it in my mouth and began to CHEW it! It tasted like tinfoil and stuck to my teeth, impossibly stuck. Then to more teeth and more. It wouldn't detach and was so hard to pry my jaw apart until, my teeth came out one by one. I had to keep chewing this metal gum until all my teeth were pulled out before I could spit it out.

It only hit me as weird when I woke and thought about it later. I was dreaming that common dream where you lose your teeth but this time I wasn't bleeding anything at all - so since every other time I've dreamt about it there were a lot of blood involved I reasoned that it was happening for realI was a scientist and apparently I was being interviewed anyway the host asked me if I could tell why do we see the ocean blue so i answered the most logical thing ever:" As we all know the smurfs existed in great numbers  in the 17th century and they used to bathe in the oceans  , eventually the blue pigment started to fade into the ocean " 
I fucking won a nobel prize for that btw I dreamt I was a woman. I am a man.I had a dream once where going down to identical water slides in a race was an Olympic sport and I was competing in it. 

I still think, looking back I was onto something there lol.Dream self: Of course I should escape from this shark swimming in the ocean of my living room. Of course. **Attention! [Serious] Tag Notice**

[Read about the real event here.] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Brian_Douglas_Wells)Maths has an (s).The rule of 72 is a quick way to estimate how long an investment will take to double in value (or how much you owe on a loan).  You just divide 72 by your annual interest rate and that gives you the number of years to double your investment.  
&nbsp;  
Example 1:  
You expect an annual stock market return of 6%.  72 / 6 = 12.  Your investments should double every 12 years.  So if you're 26 years old and you plan to retire at 62 (36 years) then your investments will double 3 times (36 / 12) by the time you retire.  If you have 150K in your investment account, it should be $600K at 62 assuming no other investments.  
&nbsp;  
Example 2:
You take out a loan for $20,000 at 10% interest.  If you pay nothing on it then your amount owed will double in 72 / 10 years, or 7.2 years.  You'll owe $40,000 in 7.2 years.  
  
It's an approximation, but it's very useful.  Read more about it [here](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp).The derivative of any constant is 0.1+5=6To find 10% of a number, move the decimal one place to the left. 

To figure the minimum tip --take 1/2 of that number and add to the number to get 15%.

To figure a sale price--take the 10% and double, triple, etc. Subtract that from the original price to get sale price. Rabbits really know how to multiplyTipping.  Say the bill is $20.

10% - move the decimal to the left one space.  $2

15% - take the 10% and add half of the 10%.  $3

20% - take the 10% and double it.  $4Mathematics is a part of Philosophy.The USA measures temperature in FAHRENHEIT, but most of the world uses the CELSIUS scale: If you leave the USA to visit a country that measures in Celsius and you want to relate the temperature to "home", 

> you multiply the Celsius temperature by 2, and then add 30 <

Example: you're in Canada and it's 10 degrees C:  10 x 2= 20;  so, 2o +30= "50"

IF it's 10 degrees Celsius in the country you're in, that's the same as 50 degrees at your home!When multiplying by larger numbers, you can decompose the number you are multiplying by into smaller numbers to make the math easier.  
&nbsp;  
Example:
For 250 x 25  
25 = 10 + 10 + 5, so  
250 * 10 + 250 * 10 + 250 * 5 =  
2500 + 2500 + 1250 =  
6250

You can use this to do some math in your head that seems really difficult, but once you break it down into smaller problems it's easier than it seems."Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, somebody spoke and I went into a dream!"

I think after death, there will be only silence...We are star stuff, we are a projection of the cosmos, an octave of it.  I think our experience on earth has limited us to thinking that everything has a beginning and everything has an end.  I've felt for a long time that here that is true, but in reality, the totality of the universe never began, it always was, and it never will end. When we die, I think we are, in a sense, judged. If we've mastered our souls then we can ascend. If not, we will return to a similar form and repeat the process. I had an anatomy teacher in high school that told us that the wonder and awe a baby's face shows could be because they are seeing the world in a completely different way than an adult, due to the fact that they are still so close to the point where they came from spiritual existence into physical existence. Graham Hancock said that modern society thinks of our brains more like transmitters, when in reality, they're a lot more like receivers.  How we interpret the messages is up to us. I've always had a deep feeling when I look at the stars, none of my friends or family share this feeling with me. I remember the first time I saw pictures from the Hubble telescope, I thought I was going to have a panic attack. How could all of those galaxies exist? But then I keep living the American way, walk into Wal-Mart, feel disgusted and can't shake the feeling that I'm squandering something really important.

We'll this one night,  while in between jobs I heard my cat running around like a demon.  I thought nothing of it and went back to sleep.  When I woke up the next morning I went to the bathroom to pee and noticed a live squirrel in the freaking toilet bowl.  It had a very confused look on it tiny little face,  I assume it was the same look I had.  

Anyways took me 20 min to get him out and lock the cat up so she would not hunt him down again.  I'm just glad I looked first and that I did not have to drop a duce.  I could only imagine trying to explain to the doctors that I had my nuts ripped off by a squirrel as I was taking a shit on it. My anxious dog throws up a lot. She's trained herself to find me when she's about to puke so I can hold her over the toilet while she barfs. Good thing she's so cute.I used to have two cats, the smaller one used to jump and turn around really quickly when she farted. It was as though she thought there was something behind her.

Dug her claws in and growled, I never made that mistake again.[Jo Jo likes to lick walls](http://i.imgur.com/CBW4hhg.jpg)I bought a new double-wide trailer.

All of my other cats and the dog were terrified of it.  Except Leroy the cat.  Somehow, Leroy knew it was our new home.  He was always hanging around it and insisted on joining me and the kids when we went in to check it out.  Leroy was first in the door and we had to give him the grand tour, open the cabinets and closet doorshe had to see every room.  Then he plopped down on the carpet and just purred with this big smarmy satisfied look on his face.  When it came time to move in I had to carry each of the other terrified cats in the door.  The dog was carried, howling and struggling in the door also. (then she got so excited she ran around on a running streak for like 5 minutes).

I just wish she'd stop doing it while sitting on my stomach :lSo I had a kids party for my 27th a few years back and we had a big rabbit piata and filled it with little haribo packets of all the awesome sweets. After said party the decapitated bunny sat on the coffee table still pretty full of sweets. 
One day I come home and the bunny is on its side and there is a little pack of sweets on the floor in front of the door. As I investigate further there are sweets in the kitchen sink, on the sofa, in the bathtub, under the kitchen sink, on my bed, in my bed, under the curtains... And so on. So my tortoiseshell cat gizmo spent the day hiding them everywhere to the point where I was finding undiscovered ones every time I vacuumed for a couple months. There were a couple packets all the way inside the recliner, stuffed under the sofas and in behind the tv.

She'd drag them up and leave them right at the car door. This one also caught pretzels in midair.


I've had a lot of weird pets.One of our cats liked cold tea. If my parents had left any at the bottom of their mugs, she would dip her paw in, catching some in her fur, and then lick the tea out of the fur. The other one ate marmite.

We also had a cat in an office I used to work at, a stray that the girls in the office decided could live there. She used to get diarrhoea a lot at night and I had to clean it up, because I was the only one on the night shift. 99% certain that it's because the girls kept giving it regular milk to drink.My cat used to jump into the shower with me and run around in the water.I had a huge, very fat, spoiled cat when I was younger. He was very particular about many things. Our favorites to share were that he would not drink his water unless it was in his favorite brown bowl, and beside the bathroom door rather than in the kitchen where his food went. And he wouldn't eat his food if he could see the bottom of the bowl. He would meow and cry lien he was starving, just to make you jiggle the bowl and cover up the bottom so he could eat some more. He also loved to wear his red bandana and would bring it to you to have you put it on for him. We called it his damn-bana. I don't know why. His name was Beenie-Weenie and he weighed 17 pounds.My cat ate lima beans and popcorn. Also, whenever he got the rips he never ran into anything, which was pretty cool because he was blind.Pet sounds by The Beach Boys is usually up there.[Man on the Moom](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/26/ManonTheMoonTheEndofDay.jpg) ...And Out Come the Wolves - Rancid

We met up at the mall, hugged, and started walkingthe dream fades out then back in. Were walking with two other people I grab her hand and she doesnt pull away and actually pulls closer to me, the dream fades out then back in for a second time. Were standing out front of a store she asks me to come in I'm reluctant but she pulls me in and I dont resist I mean I love her and id do anything to make her happy, when we stop I pull her to me we kiss then look at each other. She pulls me into a dressing room and were going at it like wild dogs i got her pinned against the wall our faces are mashed together I mean it was about to go down. Then she pushes me away a look of concern spread across her face I ask "What?" and she replies "You dont want this, you dont want me!" and runs out of the dressing room. I look for her but she's gone and I text her "All I want is you!" Then I woke up sweaty, depressed, and lonely. That was the absolute worst dream I've ever had.I had a dream that I had a friend. I don't remember his name or how his face looked, but I remember we loved each other so much. It wasn't in a romantic way, but that didn't mean that we loved each other any less. 

We spent the entire day laughing, having fun, exploring random places like empty stages, parks, and souvenir shops, and talking about life. 

At the end of the day, I knew that he had to leave and that I'd never see him again. We both started to cry, but were smiling at each other. We hugged goodbye, both happy that we had even met.

If you're the dude whose dick doesn't work, don't make a big deal out of it. Don't even hesitate, get your hands and tongue involved and make that shit happen. As Dan Savage says, don't hold a funeral for your dick.

If you're a partner of a dude whose dick doesn't work, fucking enjoy that experience and do not under any circumstances think that it's about you. Shit happens.  Masturbate with coconut oilIf she can cum from piv, after she cums, take it out and start again slow and shallow. The first inch or two is very sensitive after an orgasm. Pee after sexReciprocate oral, make noise, talk about sex, and don't ram it in her pooper without warning.When in doubt, lube. Liberally. Pinch the tip before you roll it on your dick.Don't pull out the anal beads like you're starting a lawnmower.A strong core will help you last longer in bed plus you'll look awesome. Use a piece of toilet paper to clean urine off your dick, rather than just shake it. Your underwear will be a happier non yellow color.Grapefruit techniqueMore Lube = more fun. Lube is your best friend and can really enhance a sexual experience / make it last longer when its all dry and bare. Never have sex in a hot tubFind out when your company (assuming it trades on the stock market) is looking to unveil a new product or service, or any other sort of information that the company hasn't publicly disclosed yet. Tell your friends and family about this non-public information and encourage them to buy as many shares of the company as they can. Do the same for yourself. Wait for the company to unveil its new product/service and then sell your stock at a higher price.

Edit: I feel like I shouldn't have to explain this but...

Girls - Breathe through your noseDon't cook bacon naked.Baby wipes. They are good for cleaning up any type of bodily fluids. Tissues just got stuck to stuff.when you buy condoms that are labeled "ribbed for her pleasure". put them on the other way around, so they're ribbed for your pleasure ;)When stacking two ladders on top of each other, use duct tape to hold them in place. If you're having sex and the girl says any of the following:

- Right there
- Don't stop
- Just like that  

Listen. She isn't saying "go faster/harder". She is being completely literal. She is directly telling you how to make her cum. If she says this, keep doing exactly what you're doing. If she wants you to go faster or harder, she will say those words. Sex is one of the few times that women will say exactly what they mean and want with no hidden meanings or guessing games.  If you're a girl who is comfortable enough to tell you what to do, fucking do it.When you're going down on your girl and she is getting close, do NOT change things up by going faster/harder or whatever. Just keep doing EXACTLY what you are doing. [Don't be this guy.]( http://imgur.com/vawh0JU)Here's one I've found recently, to help last longer during sex.

So cock rings basically apply pressure to the large vein thing at the base of the penis, under the balls. I didn't feel like wearing a cock ring, but I felt myself on the verge of cumming one time. So I just reached back and applied pressure on this vein with my finger. It caused my "close to cumming" to recede back. In a few minutes, I felt the urge to splurge coming back, so I pressed this again.

It basically now gives me a short "second wind" whenever I need it during sex.Place a piece of paper in your belly button when masterbating and finishing on yourself for easy clean up.When fingerbanging a lady of your heart, (unless/until given other directions) use middle and ring finger, palm facing UPWARDS. 

Press fingers up (watch the nails), rest the base of your palm on her clit adding pressure and make circular motion with a whole hand. Then start bending the middle finger, making 'come here' gesture.

Ladies can eat gassy foods and sit naked on vinyl furniture to pass vibrating toots up their vulvas. Guys: get really, really good at oral. Your dick may not work forever, but great cunnilingists are in high demand. Plus, in my experience, many women who are not normally multi-orgasmic can be multi-orgasmic with proper oral technique.

I learned this because I have a fairly small pecker and I know that I wasn't athletic enough to be the best straight fuck any woman has ever had, but I knew that if I worked on my technique I sure as hell could give them the best oral they've ever had.If you're going to use Reddit at work, disguise it using [this](https://pcottle.github.io/MSOutlookit/) and if you want to go the extra mile, sign up for a cheap VPN service to keep your activities hidden on your employer's network. 

Not all NSFW tips are sex-related. If you need to find your gf ring size, drug her with sleeping pills, then take her ring finger and put it gently up your butt. Now when you go to the jeweler, you can take that long ring diameter stick and put it up your butt, when it feels similar to when you had you gf finger up your butt, you now know her ring size 

EDIT: you all are great, its been a fun Friday reading all your comments. Don't wan't to deal with the irritation or pain of haemorrhoids or the aftermath of an extra spicy burrito? Take two squares of toilet paper, fold em over a few times then wedge it into your ass crack.  It feels a little strange at first, but won't me long till your manpon takes all your butt hole worries away. Learn to deep throat. Really not that hard and you will blow guys minds. Plus there's this thick saliva at the back of the throat that makes for great lube. That dick will slide in and out of your mouth like a well-oiled-piston. 


Also anal is extremely pleasurable with a vibrator on your clit.Don't speed up. Don't slow down. Consistency is key, but so is location. No one's gonna feel good if you're tongue cleaning her belly button.Always ask for butt stuffArch your back when doing anal. My ex used to do this thing where she would come over to "talk" and then try to have sex with me. I didn't want to so I would masturbate right before she came over. Couldn't fuck her if I wanted to.A thick dick, isn't always the best dick.Each other.A hydraulic press.I awake. Darth enters. Fine motor control and how to read cursive. Well you need to eventually write a signature when you grow up. That's part of the reason.Presumably how to read very old documents, since cursive was the main stay handwriting style. My local school system has stopped teaching it.Only thing it thought me was to read handwriting no one normally could make out. I managed to read a lot of handwritten doctor's prescriptions to the pharmacist that couldn't make it out. * For their signatures
 * How to read CursiveThere is no real reason to learn it anymore. Even when signing my name, I do it differently all the time. And even if you print your signature on a check or whatever who's to tell you that you cannot do that?There is no point, IMO. Cursive is outmoded.Fine motor control, like /u/ODB247 said.  
  
I sign most of my name in cursive, except the first letter of my first name. I never really got the hang of that one. I can't sign my middle name in cursive worth a damn, either, so I'd print it if I had to sign something with it.I don't think an Ex-KGB agent and a Lawyer really joke around with each other. Putin probably jokes about how the most powerful man in the world couldn't lick a stamp if he got into a fist fight. Putin looks like a good bar room brawler. I can see it clearly. Obama, Putin, and false whistleblower Edward Snowden having a good laugh right now.By the looks of the way Putin is handling things, he'd *prefer* to have another cold war.  How short memories are when past mistakes are repeated within the lifetime of those who witnessed the previous errors.  I guess he forgot the cold war brought an end to the USSR.I doubt it, as Putin appears to want to start it back up again.

We all know when Daniel Day-Lewis gets down to a role, he brings forth a magic transformation. But his butcher was just too good.

Butcher was a very complex character. Love for America, derision for the immigrants and collusion with criminals and political thugs, the character had his hands full. But when the movie ended, it was like every nuance of his character's personality was illustrated quite vividly.

He simply is the best.Dennis Hopper in Blue VelvetHeath Ledger- JokerJack Nicholson as the Joker. I know, Heath Ledger is creditedvas the best Joker, but Nicholson had the best protrayal as the Joker in the classical sense. and by that I mean the suit, thevrevolver, the whole presence, was a lot closer to the comic book version of the JokerLeonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candy in Django Unchained. 

Loved to hate the guy. I know it's not the typical villain but I would say Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrence in The Shining. He was perfect for the role, portraying an average and, for the most part, well adjusted man gradually and seamlessly spiral into insanity. He kept the same feel of the character from the book and was so convincing that, by the end, I was terrified that this could happen to anybody, including myself. I know someone could argue that the true villain is the hotel and its long dead inhabitants, and I would agree with you, but without Jack that could never have been expressed.
Bill the Butcher by Daniel Day-Lewis was so freaking good that I was actually rooting for him and saw Amsterdam as the antagonist.Alan Rickman as Hans GruberA lot of my favorites have been named already, so I'm going to through out Jack Gleeson.

Never has an actor made me hate a character so much as he made me hate Joffrey. Yea, the writers had a lot to do with it, but he brought a lot to that character. Lets go ahead an put in Jack Gleeson as (King) Joffrey. He successfully portrayed a character who was almost impossible not to hate. in the task of acting the villain, he was incredible.John Malkovich in *In The Line of Fire*.Kevin Spacey in...  EverythingDavid Tenant as Killgrave from Jessica Jonesalso, Daniel Brhl as Zemo in Captain America Civil Warloki and jokerWatchmen.

There was no silly, stereotypical maniac who wanted to destroy the world. Real life doesn't work like that. Many of the most evil people in the world are some of the nicest, successful, educated, logical people you will ever meet.

You can convince yourself of something that isn't true, but there's always a part of you that knows it's false.I absolutely think so. People do it all the time. Imagine a codependent relationship with an abusive man. The woman will look for any reason to think he loves her or will change. All the time people pick a narrative they prefer and find the facts that supports itYes it's called living in denial, a condition where a lie is repeated so much it becomes the truth to that person. Don't underestimate the brains power to see what it wants to see.Many people can believe delusions within their own mind, but other than that I think people simply ignore things (refuse to think about them) rather than lying to themselves.

Generally, I just try to be a decent human being. However, I still get caught being an asshole sometimes. But making fun of someone's smile or laugh is just dumb. Treat others the way you want them to treat you. It's worked out pretty well for me so far, I have a fabulously clean conscience and people generally like interacting with me.

http://www.stufftoblowyourmind.com/podcasts/the-unlanguaged-mind-feral-children/Essentially if a person was never taught language, how would they think. Because English is the language I know best, I think in English. If someone doesn't know language, what would their thought processes be like? eat shit fuck I'm assuming in imagery, but that doesn't really make sense to me. I think I remember a similar question being asked, but for people who are born deaf and blind. Like my puppy... And when he sees my parents puppy, the red rocket comes outI think that it would be at it's most primal base a binary response linked to emotions/sensations. Living things are adapted at with feedback sense, which while names very with language, are the same.

Hunger=Bad
Food gets rid of hunger therefore  Food=Good
...ect

That being said, with out outside stimuli to influence vocabulary, some for a language would be formed. While it would be specific to the one subject, it would still have meaning to them. Example; Both verbal and sign languages very from region to region. But but regions share boarders or trade tend to have some overlapping similarities with routes in a base "vocabulary". Germanic languages, and Latin/Romance languages are a prime example.

So while it is interesting to think about I think a look into Animal Cognition holds many of the answers. Though, now I must ask, would two subject sharing the same isolation for a language with each other?There was a RadioLab podcast about a boy who had no language. He had friends that also had no language. I'm gonna try and find it, but I doubt my skills. EDIT: AAAAHHHHH I FOUND IT! http://www.radiolab.org/story/91725-words/Same as an animal. They would think in feelings. The instinct alone would control them and they wouldn't need to think about much.I 'learned' i was gay about the same time you learned you were straightI learned I was straight via age = born. I knew I was bi since I was bornOther. It took a very long time because I'd never heard of anything except straight/gay/bi. Thought I was gay for a long time.I remember vaguely being 4-5 years old, I used to kiss my neighbor that was a boy but he was a year older. I used to kiss him on the lips and we would laugh about it, haha

I remember when my dad finally saw me do that he pulled me into the house and slapped me across the face and on the upper arms.I'm sixteen now and am questioning my own sexuality, I've talked to my friends about it. And I said fuck it I'll ask Reddit. I know that I'm attracted to girls but sometimes I think "I would make out with that guy right now"> /other?

I'm a table. AMAI knew I was straight when I fucked my cousin of the opposite sex and loved it.Kissed my best friend/neighbor once when I was 8 but didnt think anything of it and forgot about it until high school after a guy started hanging around me a lot and was super touchy-flirty. One day he came up behind me and just kind of held me and somethings just sort of connected in my mind as I realized, damn I really like this.Well, for my whole life I never imagined being with anyone except a male (female here). 

Around 6th grade, I started doodling naked women and suspected that maybe I was attracted to the female body. I pushed the thought out of my mind. 

When I was a young teenager, I couldn't stop checking out other girls' bodies. I was dating a guy and was definitely attracted to him, but I swore that I would experiment with girls at some point so that I could "get the urge out" before getting married to a guy. 

A few years later, I got drunk and fooled around with a friend. She and I are dating now. 

It sucks being attracted to both genders. I even have "moods". One week, I'll be craving men, and in another, I'll be craving women. It really sucks because I could be in a happy relationship with someone, and one of my moods will kick in and I'll be horny as all hell for the other gender. It SUCKS. 

My girlfriend and I are still figuring things out right now, but we're both young so we have plenty of time to get our sh*t together. Do not get into credit card debt. Seriously, its not worth it.Have a goal in life, that you suspect that you might not be able to achieve, then work towards it.

And get off Reddit.Age and experience often win out over youth and enthusiasm.start investing for retirement NOW. seriously. do it yesterday. the miracle of compound interest is more powerful the younger you start investing. 

someone who invests only from 25 to 35 years old can have more $$$ in retirement than people who invest for longer periods of time. good intro article here:

You'll get to that point in time where a lot of people you know will be getting married.  Don't feel obligated to go, especially if these are people who you haven't talked to in a long time, or are kinda-sorta friends.  If someone gives you shit for it, don't try to empathize and say, "Oh well, it's because they're stressed."  People who treat weddings like how spoiled three-year-olds treat birthday parties are just selfish brutes.  Save your money and time, and most of all, save your guilt for things that really matter.Don't get a tattoo, never drink and drive, take care of your teeth. If/when you start working, networking is very important and will save you from the pains of job hunting.If at all possible, try to spend your youth in finding a job (or at least a field) that you could realistically picture yourself spending the rest of your career doing, if it came down to that.

Once you're older and have kids, you won't want to/be able to take risks like that.Don't get frustrated that you don't have your poop in a group by the time your 25!!!!! I was 25 with no  future, crappy car, tiny apartment and a horrible job. Now I'm almost 29, married with 2 kids, with 2 nice cars for my wife and I, and looking for a nice home to buy. It happens, life gets more complete and your future will become more and more clear.Dont get too caught up about "keeping up with the Jones." That is, don't be scared about missing out on stuff. Do the work and actually earn it. Treat yourself to travel and/or special events once in awhile, but dont feel like you have to backpack across Europe or go to a concert every weekend to feel "enlightened."Enjoy your twenties they will be gone before you know it. Workout, enjoy the benefits of a body that responds well to conditioning. Stay away from Fast Food. It doesn't get any better...enjoy it while it lastsThe big one I'd advise is to try and save as much money as you can, start that as a habit now. If you don't have an IRA, open one and put as much as you can afford to into it. Think about the 'things' you want to buy, and determine if they will truly add to your happiness, or if you just 'want' them to have them. Many of the objects I purchased at that age (video game consoles, 'collectible' items, etc) in later years turned into things that hadn't really enriched my life much if at all, and ended up being valueless donations.27? Random. If you find yourself making excuses, you are wrong and need to change what you are making excuses for. - Don't worry too much about settling down with a SO. 

 - Hold off on having kids until in 30s.

  - NOW is the time to get your Bachelors or start/finish your Masters degree.  If necessary, go full time and work your ass off to finish it in 2 years (fall, spring, summer).  

- Decide where you would like to live your life and apply to every position you're wanting in that state.  It's easier to move to another city once you're in the state, than move to it later.    Okay I know this isn't advice, but after reading some of the replies I have a question. A lot of people hear are saying save up and don't spend extravagantly, which makes sense, but I have also heard people saying that this is the time when you want to travel and see the world so go do it. Any advice on how to do both?Save your money. 

Living at home is NOT a crime, problem, or sign of low status. Use the time to pay off student debt, save up and get your own place.

Come to terms with the fact that you are going to have regrets in life and learn to handle those feelings. Have & show compassion to others.Save money.  I know it's not fun but save a certain amount from each paycheck. Gets you into good habits.  If you can, learn about investing. Ideally, long term investing. There's a ton of stuff online and other good books on this. 

Eat better. Or at least be careful what you eat. Learn to cook. I know a lot of people who buy stuff already made (or just take out) and it eats up their budget like crazy. If you make it, you can freeze it ahead of time, portion it, etc. You have control over whatever you put in.

Especially on university campuses because the whole point of university is to challenge ideas opposed to your own. Grow the fuck up with these bullshit safe spaces, you're an adult deal with it.

Fuck 'em.The whole old navy/new navy (as in old vs new, not the clothing brand) argument. Yes, we get it, the navy used to be so much more brutal, but just because it was more brutal doesn't mean it was better.That "gender neutral" is an actual problem.

talk about a relationship shit-show..Encharged with planning a wedding for a friend?Yeah, I have a plan for that sort of thing.  It's called immediately going towards the most secluded part of Earth I can find.  If I can't get out of the states I'm heading for the Rockies.  I haven't been playing Fallout 4 for nothing.I don't think anybody can prepare for WWIII.Nope, I would be DOA.Before you can answer "being prepared" whom is involved? If it's everyone, where is majority of the fighting? What kind of weapons are we talking about? Has shit gone nuclear? I'm mostly unprepared but it would totally depend.Depends, how long do I have before I am directly impacted? Nope, because I try to live my life as if armageddon was not happening tomorrow, you know ... planning vacation and stuff, or just planning what to watch with my wife the weekend, **not** staying up at night overthinking if my bunker have enough anti-radiation tabs to last a year ...I live at the bottom of the pacific, so I would probably be fine. I'd just watch the fireworks.No point. I'm too close to a major city. I'd get hit with nuclear fallout within a day. Being in the central valley in CA it would be stuck here for a while. Not to mention the effect it would have on the San Andreas fault I'd have earthquakes and with the high population, freeways would be clogged and no one would be able to get out in time.In my half a minute of thought:

Given the fact that the only thing that anyone can do to prepare for that scenario is dig a bunker and stock it up, I'll definitely be unprepared in that regard.

Therefore, assuming that I may be affected - being Australian might be a benefit for once - I'll just destroy my senses in whatever way possible.

In other words, get shitfaced on whatever's at hand.I'm halfway through my Reddit feed so maybe if you guys stopped posting, I can finally go through it... Then ya I'll be ready.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AskReddit) if you have any questions or concerns.*Never hit on a woman who is working out, walking alone, or eating. And always check for a ring first

Try to strike up a conversation based on mutual interests (for example, if she's reading your favourite book or wearing a shirt displaying your favourite band or sports team). If she doesn't respond enthusiastically, gracefully take your leave

Women are most open to flirting in situations where being social is expected (parties, get togethers, clubs, any group activity) and less open to being hit on during solo activities (grocery shopping, commuting to work, etc)First point might be to not call them 'females'. Before going up and talking to a woman try to sustain eye contact first, this will give you a good gauge on how open she is to being approached. It comes off really creepy and desperate if a woman sees you approach other women and get shot down before you approach her, with eye contact you can lower the chance of rejection. I'm a women who is into both women and men. If I'm completely honest I still find going up to either gender and flirting completely terrifying but I'll try to answer. 

I think going up to someone and appearing confident, even if you don't feel it, is half the battle. Smile, introduce yourself and have a topic ready. Things like asking if they have seen the latest movie out at the cinema, bitching about work/school or asking if she has plans that summer are easy topics.  

A nice simple topic to begin with will tell you if she is interested or not. If she gives you a short answer, isn't smiling or appears distracted that's your cue to back off. If she is listening to you, holding eye contact and gives you a detailed answer then those are good signs. Basically just be aware of her body language. Ask her questions and encourage her to talk about herself.

Be bold, be polite and know when to back off is fairly obvious advice but it's the best approach in my opinion. Good luck! 
In the U.S. you can file a [complaint](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/) with the FCC, FWIW. Also add your phone number(s) to the national do not call lists. Plenty of robocall telemarketers don't bother to check against them, but it's something.Hang up. Usually, if you listen to the recorded spiel, it will tell you which number to press to be put on a Do Not Call list. It's worth wasting the 40 seconds to hear the message than to constantly get calls.Screen your calls and only pickup numbers you know. As it's neither a common occurrence, safe, or practical, no. There's no service wide rule against it.

I was going to print something in the university and I saw a stapler and decided to play with it. I ended up stapling my own thumb which made me panic so my friend and I decided that we should go to the clinic. When we got there, the nurse seemed pissed and as the naive 16 year old that I was, I asked her with a smile on my face (I was almost laughing) if she's handled many cases that were the same as mine and she answered without looking at me that that was the first time that it's ever happened in that university. My smile fell and I just sat there quiet until she was able to remove it. When I was 17 I offered to help a friend and her family move, and she actually took me up on it. So I show up bright and early and the first thing my friend's family asked us to go put change in the parking meter. So on our way down the front steps I fall off the stairs (not down, literally off), badly sprain my ankle; it's so bad it swells up larger than a grapefruit. But I stay and help for the rest of the day. 

edit: words.A few weeks ago I hacked off a good chunk of my right heel. I like to shave in the shower and my weapon of choice is a Mehaz double edge safety razor.

I came down pretty hard with 2-25 lbs dumbbells and crushed the tip of it.  I ran outside to the garbage dumpsters and stuck my head in.

I couldn't break a piece off so I grabbed a knife. I know what you're thinking and just wait for it.

I was sawing though the chocolate with modest success.  I was aware how precarious this was and didn't want to hurt myself so I stopped and put the knife on top of the stove and tried to break a piece off.  Couldn't.  So I hit it against the counter.  Once, twice, no luck.

Several more attempts, each increasing with force fuelled by my frustration.  I hit the edge of the stove element, catapulting the knife on the air.

I put my hands up and it made a nasty slice on one of my fingers as it spun by.

Way better than the bloated Adobe Reader and with Foxit you can actually edit and resave your pdfs.7zipI am obsessed with maintaining my media library and having it available everywhere. Here are my favourites:

#[Plex](https://plex.tv/)
-My All-time Favourite program. Plex is a Netflix-like organizer for all your personal media. The server is an application you download and install. You can then add media from your drives into the browser app.

-The Mobile app is also amazing and can be remotely streamed to any chrome cast on any wireless network from your phone via your home PC. When I want to watch a movie at a friend's house now I just play it on my phone, from my computer at home and cast it to their TV. Music player leaves a little to be desired--but is still great when away from your computer. 

-The mobile app is a one-time payment, computer server application is free. I do wish there was a decent desktop application though.

-One thing to note is that things can get messy if your media isn't organized and named properly. The following two programs are how I organize my files.


#[The Renamer](http://therenamer.com/)
 - Simply renames files to a given convention. Makes it easier for programs like Plex and Kodi to identify. Saves me a ton of hassle renaming media files. Takes a very minimal amount of tweaking. There's a bug with WIN10 that causes it to crash if you "browse" for the source folder. Just copy/paste it instead.

#[File Bot](http://www.filebot.net/) 
- Similar to The Renamer. I use it as a back-up scraper--usually for music as The Renamer can't do that.

#[Musicbee](http://getmusicbee.com/) 
- I recently gave up on ITunes due to annoying crashes and general shittiness--This program has blown me away. Its seriously awesome, lightweight and powerful.

#[Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) 
- ~~Need a file on your phone from your computer? Need to do anything on your home PC from your phone? Teamviewer is an easy option to remotely control your PC. As an actual remote-control Teamviewer leaves much to be desired but its the easiest option for accessing your desktop remotely.~~

- As someone mentioned below apparently there is a new vulnerability. I just uninstalled, don't risk it

#Clover. 
 
Google Chrome like Tabs for your file browser, plus bookmark options. Makes it super convenient to browse and copy paste stuff between folders. 
 
Just don't bookmark your porn folder or you'll be sweating bricks every time mummy has to use the facebook. VLC Media PlayerLeague of Legends. It's a simulator that allows the user to taste salt through visual stimulus. Just head to ninite.com and download like everythingRainmeter. Make your desktop look like not Windows and actually coolThe Camelizer.  It's a chrome addon that tells you the recent prices for any item on Amazon.   Using that information, I've decided to buy something because it was cheap relative to it's usual price, and held off because it was higher than normal.KeePass

Stop putting all your passwords in Excel, or using the same password for everything.

You don't have to even remember them or know what they are, and you can make passwords that are much more difficult to guess by dictionary hacks.

Huge fan, used it for years.Calibre if you have a lot of ~~audio~~ e-books. It's good at keeping them all organised can convert between a bunch of different formats.

Plays all media types and delivers MUCH better quality than VLC Player.

I've renamed a folder of 800 files in less than a minute using it, I'd be hard-pressed to say it took more than 5 seconds.

Great for renaming songs and movies and all kinds of things that have an index in front of them.Is there a subreddit or other website built specifically to maintain a list of open source/libre software that respects user privacy? Perhaps maintained by someone respected and more trustworthy than the individual creators, like the [EFF](https://www.eff.org)?

He has eaten nothing but the exact same thing for the last six years.I'm guessing part of it is that for dogs and cats, the very opportunity to eat something tasty and not rotten is fucking *awesome*, so it matters less what that food is and more that they have that food in the first place.We can if the food is nutritionally complete. But for humans food is more than a necessity, it's a pleasure. That's why we go long ways to have the most delicious foods.I once dreamed I had a girlfriendI was Lady Gaga and I was performing a concert inside of a tornado. I had to kill zombies with a strawHad a dream last night my wife was doing cocaine with an old farmer and his dog. She has never never been drunk or touched a drug. I had been studying the Vietnam war heavily for a few months and one night I ended up having a dream/nightmare where I had been captured by Vietcong and was about to be executed, the trigger was pulled, I heard the bang. Then I woke up drenched in sweat, out of breath and had a massive pain in the center of my forehead where the bullet would have hit. I stopped studying that history for a short time after thatI had a dream last week that [yellow pythons](https://youtu.be/8XdgA7LHB2w) that had had huge heads, fangs and two little legs were coming out of the faucets and chasing me and my family around trying to bite us.  Every time the fangs were about to sink into someone my dream would cut away.   It is still bothering me. I was in a barber shop and Taylor Swift was shampooing my hair.Legit when I was in preschool, I had a dream I was at the grocery store and my mom got on an elevator without me. Needless to say at the time I was absolutely freaking out. I remember the elevator doors closing and I didn't make it in. I vividly remember this dream and I'm 27I dreamt I posted this question instead of you.It was more like a series of dreams. When I was a young lad in kindergarten, and a little into first grade if I remember correctly, I vividly remember having the ability to teleport back to my bed whenever I wanted. To the point where when I couldn't anymore, I was genuinely confused. What I later figured out was that I was having semi-lucid dreams reliving my days at school each night and being so young I had trouble differentiating between these vivid illusions and reality. 

 I assume this happened every single night because I remember doing it very often. Whenever I was having a bad time, or I said something stupid I'd blink my eyes really hard and when I opened them I'd be in bed in the morning. It was genuinely very relaxing.trump being the next president The human race...The human raceFlying spaghetti monsterDaveCrows, or possibly ants. Both currently plotting our demise.

If you can prove you previously bought it and the only reason for emulating it was for personal use then you're fine. Yeah, I think it's fine if you don't own the game and it's over 10 years old. Yeah, I would think so.I'll stick around so I feel bad about myself First time I met her i went back to my  desk and told my supervisor I would marry her...28 years this year.Oh I got a nice one for this. Or sad one.. I'm from Germany and in summer 2013 I was in England for two weeks. It was kind of a language course and there were about 60 other students in my age. Two weeks passed and I had a lot of fun meeting people, living at a host family and doing stuff with my frined who had come with me. On our last evening, when there was almost no time to meet the others, because early in the morning we had to return, the whole group ate pizza at a restaurant. I sat there with my friend and all of the sudden a girl I haven't seen before sat down on the other side of the table. We had one of the most magical and enthusiastic conversations EVER. It was amazing. I've never before felt such a deep and strong connection to anyone. We were definitely meant for each other. Unfortunately we were seperated, because when we had to go back to Germany, I got to know she lives in the south and I rather in the north. I'm so glad I asked her for her number, usually I am not the guy to make such a optimistic move when getting someone to know. We chatted since then everyday on Whatsapp and it is still amazing, because she felt the same way I did in that restaurant: our conversation was absolutely fantastic and we soon fell in love with each other. There are like 500km between us and we didn't have the chance to meet each other yet, but we will. And as soon as I can finally hug and feel her, this story will be complete.After ten years of forced captivity, we're happy.Awkward high school best friends. One went military, other waited for them. Now married and expecting their firstborns.I met her when she was a freshman and I was a jr. I knew I wanted to marry her that day. Was friendzoned for 5 years while she dated other guys. I never dated anyone else, and now we've been married for nearly 4 years and have a 6 month old.My wife and I were classmates at high school.I was the popular guy back then and she was what people would call a not-so-pretty girl. She had a deep crush on me. We seldom talked to each other but somehow were good friends.I was in a hot relationship with another popular girl in the same class during the entire high school years and had another two girlfriends after that. ( Never been single for more than 3 months since 14)After broke with "the last girlfriend", I asked her (my wife) out and had dinner for only god knew why. During the dinner, I looked at her and somehow my mind told me "she is the one. I gotta make her my wife."I just got truly in love with her all of a sudden with all my hearts, not as a so-called backup lover.We dated for three weeks after that dinner and got married.We've been happily together with a cute 5-year-old daughter ever since. It's like a real life fairytale to both of us.PS. And time proved that she is the best woman I can ever have in my life. I was born rich but went through a hard family business failure two years after the marriage and almost went broke. She didn't leave or complain. She single-handedly supported me and our new-born daughter for about two years before I got back on my feet financially again.Now we are no longer as rich as we used to be moneywise, but our experience and life is much richer. I cherish her as the best blessing in my life.TL;DR think How to Lose a Man in 10 Days, except nothing like that....depends on the sub.
